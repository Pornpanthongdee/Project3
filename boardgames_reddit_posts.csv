boardgames,Hot takes on Essen Spiel 2022 hotness,False,144,0,"Hi all,

Last thursday was my sixth time at the Essen Spiel con. Employing some of the gained experience (intended time of arrival, parking place, entrance, plan for the day), we managed to snatch everything on our wish list, which coincidentally overlaps a lot with the BGG hotness. I wanted to share some of my hot takes on these games with you after our first plays since.

Some general remarks:

\- I am a true euro gamer, some favorites include Feast for Odin, Brass, Concordia.

\- English is not my first language.

\- These are HOT TAKES, not reviews! All games may evolve at multiple plays, player counts, states of mind, etc.

**Maui**

We played this family weight tile-laying game with 2P at the convention and had high hopes due to the combination of publisher (Next Move Games), artist (Chris Quilliams) and designer team (known from Jaipur, Botanik and more). 

I'll cut to the chase, this play was a disappointment. The production is very average and some components are straight up bad for a retail price of 35 euros (I'm looking at you, flimsy single sheet cardboard boards). While the art is cute and mellow, it is also very repetitive. Finally, gameplay wise, it was fine. The core mechanism is choosing towels to make color matches, to advance on generic point tracks. There is some strategy involved in the 'direction' you want to move up and down the board as you can pick up little bonuses on the beach (again, pretty boring set collection). I found the little economic sand dollar mechanism mostly frustrating, and my overall feeling was that this game would get old very quickly. However, it plays in 15 to 20 minutes and there is a variant included which I have not played that might add some depth. Not for me, might be fun for families and kids.

**Heat: pedal to the metal**

Very anticipated game since we all like Flamme Rouge. Played this 4P at the hotel, just 1 race on the USA map without any of the modules. It played very snappy, and the race took us 30 minutes. First impressions are very good, and this is the game I have been thinking about the most since playing it. There is a cool game of chicken going on around the corner/slip stream mechanic, and the push your luck of boosting fits right in. However, I am happy that there are different modules included, since the base game is very.. basic. A little less going on than in base Flamme Rouge as you pilot 1 car instead of 2. The price is justified since the modules/content is plenty and production is top notch, in Days of Wonder fashion. Anyway, can't wait to play a championship with all modules next week!

**Astra**

Played this yesterday at home with 3P. Did not read into this game at all. I think it's Mindclashes first family weight game You fill in stars on different constellation cards in a communal tableau using dry erase markers, and the person who finishes a constellation gets to keep it and use the card for its special power and a set collection end game scoring. People who contributed get to choose a boon. When you run out of stardust which is used to mark off stars, you take a rest action. I found a part of the rest action very annoying, since you get to refresh your acquired and used cards, but only if the elements depicted match the one on the main bord. But you have no agency over the displayed element; it just rotates clockwise between 4 types, after every other rest action. 

Overall, it did not feel like there were many interesting choices to be made and I felt little enjoyment going through the motions. At least it didn't take long (30-45 minutes). Components are good, but I don't get why we have to dry-erase instead of just having player colored stardust to be placed on the cards. It's always a bit messy with dry-erase markers.

**The Great Split**

4P game at the hotel. This game is slick and stylish as heck, and pictures certainly don't do the foil / metallic elements and excellent recessed played boards justice. It is a pretty light game, I would say slightly above Ticket to Ride weight. Everything revolves around the titular I split/you choose mechanism, which fuels an array of goods/contract tracks. Every track has it's own way of scoring, and they are all interesting and viable. There is more player interaction than expected, as it is imperative to keep track of you neighboards when you decide how to make your own split, which you hand to the left, and the split you get to decide on, which you get from the right. After the first round this game played very snappy (&lt;45 minutes) and overall left a great impression on us all. With the setup and scoring variability included, I think this will be an excellent filler, and also a very interesting welcoming game for new players. The only problem that comes to mind is one similar to Puerto Rico; an experienced/good player receiving splits from a newbie/bad player will probably have an edge for the whole game, as you go clockwise for the whole game. However, for this weight and lenght this isn't a problem for me personally.

**King of Monster Island**

Co-op King of Tokyo / New York sounded like a recipe for succes for me - I like these games, but my wife strongly dislikes the negative interaction and player elimination. Played this at 2P (with wife) and had a blast. The production is amazing, with usual vibrant King of \*\*\* art, chunky dice, fun cards and now also a volcano dice tower! The easiest scenario (Crystal Dragon on easy side) was not much of a challenge, but the game totally delivers the King of \*\*\* experience in co-op mode, with wacky powers, unpredictable events and big turns that make you feel awesome. I did not have a light weight dice chucking 30-45 minutes co-op experience yet, and this fits that category perfectly.

**Flamecraft**

Cuteness overload, played with 4P at hotel. This was the last game we played that night, and were a bit tired, and it took us a bit longer than 60 minutes. First of all, the value of this game is INCREDIBLE (I am talking about the standard, non-deluxe 35 euro version). Amazing artwork, neoprene playmat, large high quality cards, screen printed player dragon meeples; just hold this game next to Maui, and you will scratch your head how they can have the same price tag. The game itself is a clever action selection / resource gathering / contract fullfillment game with fun positive player interaction, as shops get progressively better, and you get the feeling of building the city up together. One of the artisan dragons (which got played frequently) lets you gift resources to other players for points! There is also plenty of variability in shops, fancy dragons and helpers, so replay value seems good at first glance. Overall, loved it! A good vibes family-plus weight game. Might be troublesome for very analysis paralysis prone players, as there is a lot of different stuff to do, and the choices open up even more as the game progresses.

**Atiwa**

I am a BIG Uwe fan, and was super pumped for this one. To our surprise, Atiwa is pretty different to his other farming themed games; it certainly is not the next Agricola/Caverna. Tip for new players/teachers: include a dummy first round of the game, since I found it hard to wrap my head around the game flow after hearing the rules explanation. But, after the first round it all clicked. We finished it in 60 minutes at 2P.

This game has an intriguing ecosystem of animals, trees, fruit and fruit bats which ties in beautifully with the core worker placement mechanism. I like that you can't aquire more workers, like in Nusfjord and Ora et Labora you play with 3 each round of the game (because in Uwe games that let you get more workers, it usually is the easiest path to victory). The art and production are fine and what you expect from Lookout. Concluding, I enjoyed the first play very much. However, I am worried whether this game has legs so to speak. There are limited ways to earn victory points and the breeding mechanism is dictated by the same prerequisites each round. It feels very inefficient to not work towards these prerequisites, as it literally gives you free stuff, and the amount of actions you can take is limited (to 3 workers time 7 rounds). We will see.

**Lacrimosa**

Maybe THE hottest Essen Spiel 2022 game? The queue for Devir was the longest one for sure :). Played two times already, at 2P and 3P. Long story short, it lives up to the hype. A very expensive game at 70 euros, but even the box in shrink screamed 'premium', and after opening it I think the price is justified. Stunning artwork, way better in person than on pictures, and every component is top-notch and designed with a purpose.

I will not delve into the mechanisms as Candice Harris wrote a wonderful in depth preview on BGG which I highly recommend: [https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/136882/spiel-22-preview-finish-mozarts-requiem-lacrimosa](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/136882/spiel-22-preview-finish-mozarts-requiem-lacrimosa)

We all loved it. The game is heavy, but plays very smoothly and is laid out intuitively. All necessary information can be found on the board / components, and ultimately every turns boils down to picking 1 card for it's action and 1 for it's income from a selection of 4. There is subtle interaction in all sections of the board; memory cards and opus cards you eyeball/work towards might get snatched, the travel mechanism uses a shared pawn which means locations you want to visit might get snatched or you move further away from them, and the masterpiece commissions are an area control game between 2 composers you can support. At 2, the game was pretty mellow and a bit more loose, but at 3 there was already plenty of competition for the best cards/spots/commissions. I imagine that the 4P game can get cutthroat and you have to pivot your plans even more often. Out of all games played, this one impressed me the most, and I look forward to explore it further at all player counts and solo.

**Crossing Oceans - sorry, this is a bit of a rant**

Last and sadly least, my biggest disappointment of this Spiel. Concordia is a 10/10 game for me and I cherish my copy, singed by Mac Gerdts himself, blinged out with all expansions, maps and insert. This game.. is not that. I bought Transatlantic the year it released and thought it was fine. I sold it after a couple of plays as Concordia gave me a similar experience, but better. This game was supposed to be Transatlantic 2. I have to report that this is not even a 1.5 version, and in my opinion a huge step backwards. I seriously wonder why and how 5 years of development were necessary to arrive at this stripped down, worse Transatlantic. Played at home at 2P.

More than 75% of the components are literally Transatlantic components. There is also an upgrade pack available to convert your game to Crossing Oceans, point for PD Verlag for that. The components, and the artwork (I think only the main board has artwork that is new compared to Transatlantic), are servicable. I hate the paper money.

The game removes the Concordia-like cardplay and replaces it with a rondel. A very BORING rondel. In the process, like half of the actions from Transatlantic got removed, and certainly the more interesting actions. Furthermore, you can't see what the actions do anywhere? There were player aids mentioned in the rulebook, but they are not listed on the components list, and are most certainly not included in the box. Very bad decision, as now the rulebook has to be kept at hand for at least a couple of rounds of the game.

Furthermore, not only actions got cut, but also scoring opportunities. You just score for money, pieces on the board, and a set collection mechanism of boats multiplied by 5 tracks on the player board. No more scoring for rows, no more scoring during the game.

The result of all this? A game that is boring, has a clear 'best action' each round, and kind of plays itself. I have 3 green boats, what do I do? I max the green tradehouses. I have maxed out my green tradehouses, what do I do? I buy as many green/wild boats/docks as possible since they score 10 points each. Now I have no money, so I play the actions that earns me the most money. Rinse and repeat. I never felt smart playing this game and was done halfway, but, it dragged on (about 90 minutes). Oh, and to make matters worse, the weirdest end game mechanism makes the game drag on even LONGER! After the deck runs out all players have not one, but 3 more actions to go through. Never again.

Mac, I hope you can now let the steam boat theme go, and focus on something new..

I hope this was informative for some of you, and remember, these are subjective opinions based on first plays!

boardgames,Your Boardgames,False,10,0,"Earlier this year, I moved into a flat that has a lot less space than my previous house. This meant I had to cull some possessions. My boardgame collection was quite large, for a casual gamer, and contained a number of games that either rarely saw the table or had never been played. I therefore decided to sell some to local game stores for their ""Stay &amp; Play"" areas. 

This got me thinking: I much prefer having a smaller, refined collection of games that get played more frequently as this makes me feel like I'm getting my money's worth and also means I'm more likely to remember the rules! I also like the fact that my collection is now a reflection of me. These thoughts have definitely informed how and what I buy now.

##FAQ

**I live in Peru/Canada/Jamaica/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the fundamental democratic values of my county are falling apart!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on this growing new thing called LSD, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

boardgames,"Tarot-sized clear-back card sleeves, fit for shuffling?",False,2,0,"Needing sleeve recommendations!

Titanshield has either discontinued their clear tarot-sized product line or has just dropped the ball on supply chain with no ETA available on when new product will be available. Which is a bummer for me because all my tarot-sized board game cards are sleeved in these as they were a great product (never had one split in years of shuffling and a nice textured back). But now I'm having to desleeve whatever game I'm not playing in order to bring a different game to the table, which is a time-consuming nuisance.  


Perfect recommendation would be a competing product that is so identical they can be shuffled together, so I can just buy sleeves for new games/expansions without having to replace all my old Titanshields.

Acceptable recommendation would be a competing product that meets the same needs, and I'll just have to eat the cost and replace all the Titanshields (and this time probably buy a few hundred spares just in case this happens again).

Upon doing a little research I found that these two people filed hundreds of cases against game stores  and companies nationwide.

Anthony Toro and Jasmine Toro are the two parties involved in the filings.

So far they've sued Crafty Games of Washington, Games of Berkeley in California, Black Rowan Games in Tracy, California, GMT Games in Hanford, California,  GameScape North in San Rafael, California, GameKastle and more.

They're not really looking to see if these sites are compliant, they're simply sending out demands for settlement.  Regardless, if you own a game store, or know of one, let them know to get their site tested immediately for ADA compliance, hire a company to handle the lawsuit when/if it comes, or simplify their site in such a way as to make it ADA compliant.

We're losing our gaming spaces and friends in the community to these trolls.  These people have no intentions of making the world better for disabled people, they're only looking to make money.

boardgames,"Familiar Tales - clarification needed on Era 2, Chapter 6, Scenario 1",False,2,0,"I marked this post as a Spoiler so I won't be adding spoiler tags to individual bits of information in the post itself, so if you clicked to reveal this post out of curiosity but don't want anything actually spoiled for your Familiar Tales campaign, turn back now.

The scenario is titled Pengrauss' House and the story trigger that I need a clarification on is 602. The familiars grab the tome that Pengrauss had hidden away from Lord Perish. In the narration it explains the book is crazy heavy and Blaze says the group will have to travel light. It then has this bit of text...

&gt;Each familiar can only bring one item card in their pack. A familiar's starting item card does not count towards this limit.

If I'm reading this correctly the game wants us to trash EVERY item we've crafted so far or have gained from story moments (both equipped and in our Stashes) expect for 1 item each + starting cards?!?!

That's such a massive loss out of nowhere that I had to ask a second opinion on if this is actually what it is telling us to do or if I'm just misunderstanding something. We've been doing good making sure that we forage everything whenever possible so we've managed to craft *everything* in the item deck expect for like one weapon from Era 1 that we didn't really want anyway. Throwing that all away would be totally brutal.

Please no specifics spoilers for the story following where I am in the game but if there's some explanation like ""don't worry, you'll get a bunch of great stuff early in Era 3 to make up for it"" that would be both reassuring and not what I'd consider a spoiler. Thank you

Edit: I don't think I left anything out of my post that would be important, but if you want to see some pics of what I'm referring to, here you go. I think the scenario is on page 45 (or if not, it's right around there) of the scenario book

boardgames,Clank! Replayability without expansions. Suggestions.,False,8,0,"Hi! I leave in Brazil. Clank! was released here a long time ago and was never reprinted. I don't even know if the expansions were released here. Recently I travelled to the US and after years trying to geet this game, I finally bought one (usually pople charge 3x de value for this type of out of print games here).

My group and I loved the game! It's so easy to teach, set up and play. The first time we playerd 4 times in a row.

But I'm already afraid of the low replayability of the base game. We tried the Companium App that adds the Lieutenant, but it's too dam random... 70% of the time nothing happens, and when happens it's not even guaranteed if you are the one that will get screwed, if everyone will get screwed, or if everyone except you will get screwed.... The game have already enough randomization at it is, we didn'y like the Lieutenant... But the Companion for points and setup it awesome.

As I leave in Brazil, I don't really have the option of buying expansions to get extra cards and maps. What are the options to get more replayability out of this game? I'm trying to find game board images to print, but I'm not being able to find any.

Any suggestions?",,10,,8,,public

boardgames,[COMC] first collection post after three months.,False,0,0,"Hey everyone\~ Figured I’d post my collection here. I’ve been in the hobby since about August, but I did have some games beforehand as well. Root base, seven wonders, axis and Allies, and risk legacy and a game called redshirts.

[https://imgur.com/a/9fxn6mb](https://imgur.com/a/9fxn6mb)

But then I started a board game night at my place weekly and quickly fell down the hole lol. Overall I like my collection I think, but obviously there could be more. NEED MORE. Though I do and don't regret getting arkham horror 3rd.

My partner and I were talking about getting back into games because we both had fond memories of playing Arkham Horror 2nd a while back, and I was able to net the base game and all expansions of 3rd for 75 bucks (a great deal). But we haven't played it and it seems we have a lot of interests in other games that we have and are getting. They're all still unopened so maybe I can sell them to someone else who may appreciate them more.

But as a quick run down of the collection let's see. Starting from top left and working are way through:

**Secret Hitler**: one of my favorite social deduction games, simple and easy to get into and the tongue in cheek theme is a hoot.

**CAH**: never play it anymore, have it at this point just because it's there and decoration more than anything.

**Nyet!**: a trick taking game that I can't quite grasp

**Skull**: Just got this as a birthday game! We played several rounds last night and had a blast, quick and easy bluffing game.

**Lovecraft Letter**: played loveletter with a friend a while back and this is more of the same with some added twists, plays really fast and is pretty fun.

**Redshirts**: haven't played this in ages but I remember it being quite fun

**MTG**: it's magic.

**Root &amp; Expansions**: Very asymetric and I find it quite fun, love getting it to the table, but takes a WHILE

**Nemesis &amp; Expansions**: my first 'big game' I purchased, I really enjoy Nemesis, with lockdown being preferred because I think it just adds to how the players end up interacting. would love to itch my collector scratch and round it out with the rest of the expansions.

**Scythe &amp; Expansions**: Most recent aquire, played this last night with just the base game, was super fun, it's deceiving in that you think it's going to be a punchy shooty robot game but then it's just a Euro, but it's a damn good euro!

**Splendor**: Gift from a friend, I know it's a classic but haven't played it yet.

**Whitehall Mysteries**: LOVE THIS GAME, secret movement is just so fricken good. want to play it more.

**betrayal at house on the hill**: can't say what others haven't already, I played this a few times and in the past with friends at their place. When it's good its good, but not every haunt is good so it's kind of a coin toss on if the game will be a good one or not. may leave collection.

**Dead of Winter**: I played this with friends years ago as well, haven't played my copy yet, but it's a fun game, really depends on the group I think tho.

**Arkham Horror &amp; Expansions**: see above

**Elder sign**: man I wanted to l ike this game, but it's just far too random. It really depends on luck of the roll for anything and I can't say I enjoy it at all.

**Tsuro**: *chef's kiss* a fricken' classic, I love this game, super simple and just fun.

**Azul**: I play this two player with my partner a lot, and it has just enough complexity to really give that strategic itch.

**Smallworld**: Risk Lite, it's ok.

**7 Wonders**: played it a few times, nice little game, I enjoy it

**Axis &amp; Allies**: partner's game, haven't played it yet but they have a fondness for it?

**Risk Legacy**: partner's game as well, we've played it several times, always  a hoot and a half.

Not pictured and incoming: **Eclipse Second Dawn of the Galaxy**! Got this bad boy ordered and coming in and I can't WAIT to get it to the table!

boardgames,Discussion on writing in board games.,False,9,0,"I don't mean rulebook writing but all the other writing;  what you read in game intros, flavor text, text based games, books published related to a game, apps, and so forth.

What writing had been memorable to you?

**Galaxy Trucker** is probably the one that sticks out most, especially because the flavor text in the rulebook helps reinforce the rules, which you may have used when explaining the game to newcomers.

Mixing flavor text with the gameplay; somewhere out there Ben Croshaw is cracking a smile.

Shout out to the Rocky Road novel as well!  The whole truck driver scam chapter felt like a lost Douglas Adams notebook.

**Mice and Mystics** was rather enjoyable.   Especially the chapter midway in the book where all heck breaks loose and every game mechanic dumps into the same battleground!    I can still picture what was happening in my head.

Sadly, that is all that stands out to me.

---

Is it me or does good writing in board games feel lacking?   Of course this opinion is coming from me, someone who has no experience with writing and ""more of a math guy"".

FFG in particular all feels, well, bland. 

I skip the flavor text on Arkham games after 10 years of seeing them.   Descent 1st and 2nd edition felt like fantasy templates to copy and paste.

The Hour of the Huntress, one of many in the Asmodee library of stories, just didn't interest me enough to read any of the other board game novels like Arkham, or the Terraforming Mars novel.  Has anyone read that book?

Oh and the apps.   Destinies gets some points for some silly things like arm wrestling the king of Bavaria but all these app games are like ""you need to find a mushroom.  You fail to find the mushroom.  There is a door instead, the door has a sturdy lock and you can't just hit it with your axe you started the game with.  That would be rude"".

Now of course what players themselves come up with will be far more entertaining amongst themselves.   How many of you picture Jenny Barnes as a Duel weilding John Woo badass who don't take no sass?  Who imagines the jock from Betrayal at House on the Hill whose battle cry is shouting FOOTBALL before punching a monster right in the face?

Maybe that is the goal?  Less effort on flavor, more effort on a blank slate for the player to fill?

Video games today however are a joy to read, with indie titles like Outrr Wilds, Disco Elysium,  or anything by Greg Casavan to name a few.  Could quality like this be transferred to board games?

This insight won’t cover changes between the first edition of the game to this one, it will simply show some of how the design of the new edition changed over time.

# The Board

There are several things that evolved on the board. I think there were maybe 3 main versions of the board overall, with minor adjustments being made or even flipping back and forth within each version. The original board design at launch of the Kickstarter ([https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/361/619/a1771c0e3bc94fa5fef51db4957c1cd3\_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1619973354&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d06cb91e31fb3cd2c25a482b22a1f099](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/361/619/a1771c0e3bc94fa5fef51db4957c1cd3_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1619973354&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d06cb91e31fb3cd2c25a482b22a1f099)) looks quite similar to the final design today. The ribbon layout, VP track, and India map are all basically the same as the final printing.

You’ll notice the game turn track is on the top right and next to that was how the policy wheel was handled for laws. There was a token that would move around that board similarly to how the PM wheel works now, and then there were chits that would slide down the center as a means of showing the Power Value of things such as Luxuries and Shipyards. The number of chits for an item represented how much they were worth (start of game Luxuries were 2 and Shipyards were 1, but if a policy caused another chit to get slotted in the Luxury chit below would get pushed out).

The 2nd iteration (snagged from Cole’s playtesting via Discord: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/813093035767234570/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/813093035767234570/unknown.png)) brought us closer to the final design, moving the prizes to the left side of the board, and moving the Army boxes vertically down the center. The biggest change here though is the Court of Directors has shifted up (and also worked a bit differently).

The final design ([https://boardgamegeek.com/image/7033488/john-company-second-edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/7033488/john-company-second-edition)) moved the policy wheel off the board to a separate game piece, put the court of directors back to basically where it was, placed the game turn track at the start of the ribbon, added a pensioners box, a votes tracker on the right side, and many minor adjustments (and gorgeous art).

# The Game Flow

Promise cubes made their way over from the first edition of the game, and even had end game VP implications ([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/793875394415034427/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/793875394415034427/unknown.png)) These cubes were eventually removed altogether and little systems were added to replace them such as simply getting consent from players verbally to allow nepotism hiring, and adding Promise cards as additional means of bargaining.

Where the game currently uses an Opportunity Marker to allow for momentum buildup with Family Actions, the original action economy was based around a family’s children being used to get things done. Players would receive a child (family token) and be able to use that to thematically send their child off to work at the shipyards or workshops (to gain the enterprise card), send them off as a writer, or enlist as an officer. Initially, based on player count, you would receive 1 or 2 children in a round, with rounds alternating. You might start round 1 with a single child to take a single action, and then round 2 have double the action economy which could be split between different things if desired. There was even a promise card, “Child as a ward”, where someone could cash in to gain your precious child for their own action. This was a fun system as it felt restrictive, made the “Child as a ward” promise incredibly intriguing, and allowed you to diversify your actions when you had more than one child. This is a system that many earlier play testers miss, myself included, but the loss of action flexibility is replaced with each player making more difficult decisions for their actions, deciding if they want to stay the course to gain the benefit of an action twice, and potentially opens up negotiations with others as my ability to buy 2 shipyards this turn means maybe I’ll buy the second one for you if you can make it worth my while.

The secondary income known as Power was originally called Prestige and was earned in similar ways through Prestige cards (and if you were a Commander when the game ended). Power for Trophies and Laws Passed were added later. The concept of VP for those with the most Prestige was still a thing ([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png)) as well as converting assets. Prestige VP eventually changed to a flat +4/+2/-3 VP whereas those with most and second most Prestige got 4/2 VP and whoever had the least lost VP. Sucks to suck. Later on the idea of the VP gain being varied based on what turn the game ended was added.

There was a point if the company was successful, you would have a Final Retirement phase which required rolling for attrition, retiring these pieces, THEN paying the overall upkeep of your prizes. Now you don’t have to pay upkeep for these final retirements (phew). I can’t remember if upkeep was required even in the case of company failure back then, but it certainly isn’t now (which has absolutely put me in situations where I needed the company to fail else my precious old people would get kicked to the curb!) Also the cost and VP gain for prizes were adjusted once, maybe twice, with the larger prizes ultimately getting boosted for both if I recall correctly.

**Other misc items:**

There was also a point where the game could have a “Courtesy End”, forcing company failure if every share in the Court of Directors consented. Wacky!

Things went back and forth on bonus writers via the 4+ vacancies rule. This was something added due to circumstances (especially with lower player counts) where there weren’t enough writers and too many offices to fill and thus offices were just never hired. At one point the rule was you treated the Enlist Writer action as if your opportunity marker was already on it (meaning if you hadn’t taken Enlist Writer last turn you could take it this turn for 2 writers) to what it is now which is just a +1 meaning those with opportunity can gain 3 writers for this action (making it a massive 4 if Tenure Limits is in play). Haven’t seen many issues with offices not getting hired after that change!

I recall tweaks were made to the way Company Standing and Debt were handled, and what effected these items. Rebellions used to cause Standing to go down, then didn’t, then did again! But now it’s simply if a region is lost. The debt track disappeared altogether at one point and was handled by company standing track.

The timing for when Shares entered the Court of Directors changed back and forth a few times. It used to be during the Hiring phase, and then there was debate whether it was okay to have shares enter before the Firms phase, and now it’s been simply added to the end of Family Actions with the clarification that new shares can’t be invested into firms. Easy.

Company Failure cards were a crazy “last minute” addition. This was near the end of development as we were fighting over how Governors should work, and Cole thought that there needed to be a balance to make players working actively against the company have some fear of repercussions. This also replaced the “end game noise” that was lost from the removal of Hidden Interest cards. They’re one of the wilder ideas in the game, but they add a dramatic flourish!

# The Prestige Cards

Prestige cards were very different from the split between enterprise, spouses, and blackmail cards we have today. There were doubles of each card in a deck of 40. Then these were replaced by a deck of 48 cards with 6 copies of 8 suits which had different power and ways of scoring. A the end of the game you score each suit of prestige cards you have in hand and play area. The powers and scoring method were designed to encourage negotiation and reward specialization. I may have joined a bit later (and my memory is fuzzy) so for those who remember the older cards and how London Season was handled please chime in! Checking my notes I see mentioned of prestige card adjustments that made marriage worth 2x prestige, 3 Bishops being worth 6 and having a vote and inheritance, alterations to the number of prestige cards based on scenario setup.

Eventually we got to the simpler system of 3 cards in the display, and whoever spends the most for retirement gets first dibs. Blackmail cards were initially Secrets, with hidden scoring conditions for the end game (like have the most promise cards from other players). In retrospect I do miss this element quite a bit. Eventually Blackmail cards came to be with sneaky actions people could take, and power values were added to them. There were even some that still had “Hidden Interests” which were goals to achieve that gave you 3 power at end of game (like have most shipyards). The power used to be viable only if the card was played, then it was decided that having the card period was good enough to keep the power value.

Spouses were eventually changed from being worth power to being worth straight VP with an offset of some kind of limitation for the game. One last addition to spouses (which I contributed but Cole and I may have just been on the same page during that discussion) was to give Spouses a discount on retirements. There were a few ideas thrown around for some kind of retirement benefit with spouses, and the discount won out. I have made incredible VP gains from having a few spouses with discounts that really add up!

# The Enterprises

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png)

While ultimately small changes overall, Enterprises kind of went through a wild ride. At the start Shipyards cost £3, Luxuries were £6, and Workshops were variable depending on the Company’s balance. If the company made less money in a round Workshops would be cheaper, but if the Company made more money Workshops would be less (and you may have to pay upkeep on them). This was a great system that I didn’t get a chance to play with too much before it was removed entirely for a fixed cost of £4.

Now workshops are £5, worth 2 votes, a passive income of £1, and will earn you a VP if the company fails. As seen above they used to be worth passive income of £2 and didn’t get you a VP. If you invested a Workshop you lost your votes, but this was eventually altered.

What feels pretty late in the design process there was a sudden decision to drastically reduce the cost of Shipyards and Luxuries. While it may not seem like a price cut of £1 is all that much for Shipyards, let me tell you it alters the dynamics of the game a LOT. Suddenly it’s easy to want to snag another shipyard, and they can be financially lucrative now as they recoup their costs quicker. This was one of the more exciting changes that occurred, and made us raise our eyebrows and go, “oh wow, that’s nuts”.

And let’s talk about Luxuries getting slash from £6 to £5 to eventually £4! That’s a massive discount for 2 VP and makes Luxuries something that players will actually go for. Before this change these were things rarely sought after, except maybe a late game boost. Now they’re a reasonable grab, especially for players who either just have extra coin to spend or who need to make up for lack of retirements. You’ll notice that these now are subject to a Window tax (as are the prizes) which was another concept added much later in the design to penalize more successful players.

# The Offices

**The Chairman**

\- Used to start with a Prestige card off the top of the deck.

\- Court of Directors had a fixed maximum of 6 shares, and a specific way of handling the vote for the new Chairman which totally eludes me at this point so if someone remembers chime in. Eventually the court size was eliminated, and elections were simplified to a majority vote for someone.

\- The Chairman used to not count as a Share, but now does. Also, the way they handled debt has been altered. Now the Chairman can take a whopping 3 debt without any permission, before they needed consent from the court, or at one point needed at least half of the court’s approval. Chairman also had a Special Envoy action that allowed them to peak at cards and remove all chaos (now what would simply be a closed order) from a region.

**Director of Trade**

\- Used to be allowed 3 transfers.

\- Special Envoy from Chairman office was moved to DOT with their treasury being spent on dice for the check. This treasury had a max of £5 then £6 but eventually the limit was removed.

**Manger of Shipping**

\- Used to have to fit player ships first, but then was given allowance to fit Extra ships instead of desired. This certainly made a big change in how this office operates, as now Shipping has some leverage to negotiate with other players versus simply going through the motions of the job. “I’ll fit your ship for a pound” should be etched into the side of the box.

\- Extra ships were an interesting addition as well, allowing for more flexibility for larger trades even if players hadn’t invested in enough shipyards. I can’t remember if Company Ships were always indestructible, but I believe they were. Player ships didn’t always have the ability to flip on fatigue though.

\- Shipping could also their own shipyards if there were no player ships to fit, but these shipyards were replaced by Company Ships to make things easier.

**Military Affairs**

\- I’m not sure much if anything changed here. If I’m wrong let me know!

**Commanders**

\- Commanders used to get exhausted like any other office, but were changed to only get eliminated on catastrophic failure (and eventually changed based on majority of officers.

\- Commanders used to have 2 actions, which basically got rolled into the singular Deploy action later in development. Commanders could either quell unrest in an EIC controlled region (remove unrest and open orders) or they could invade. Now the singular Deploy action does one or both of these things depending on the targeted region, making things a bit simpler. Regiments used to get death checks as well, in the case of failed invasions or lost offices. Eventually Regiments were made to become Terminators that couldn’t be killed, and the death checks were altered in several ways.

\- Death checks used to be a standard check, then became something that happened if a skull was rolled during a Commanders action, then were changed to being required for all officers used during any Commander action but only being eliminated on 6s. There was a lot of tweaking the death check system and way the armies worked. Regiments now being permanent fixtures means the company needs to be careful about adding more, as they (like company ships) are going to be an increasing expense that will likely never go away (unless we were to go to War with France perhaps).

\- A new loot system was put in place where the player with the most officers took half rounded down, then the next most took what remained, with anything left going to the presidency. Then the system was just rolling a die after successful invasion and getting the amount rolled, split between folks. I believe actually that the die with the skull had a few different loot values on it and so you’d invade, if successful roll the loot die, and then get to split the loot amount or people died if the skull was rolled.

\- Regiments were changed to not get loot and not cost upkeep, then eventually changed to being part of the loot split and being an expense.

\- Having a Commander at the end of the game used to gain you 1 power, and then this was removed entirely. Eventually power was added back by Commanders gaining trophies for successful invasions or defense against attacks. Region loss caused a Commander to lose all of their trophies, but eventually was changed to half rounded up.

**Presidents**

\- The Presidency used to have a strict order of Commanders, President, Governors. Eventually this was swapped so that Governors acted first, then Commanders, then President. Fairly late in the development Cole realized that it didn’t matter with the way each of these offices had been tweaked and the President could just be given the opportunity to choose the order (and often times there are much more optimal orders depending on the board state such as Governors going first to give Commanders regiments to open up closed orders for the President to trade, or President guaranteeing a trade first and then deciding to give remaining money to Commander for local alliance, etc etc)

\- Used to only be able to trade X orders where X was the lower between number of ships and writers. Eventually Writers were no longer a bandwidth limitation and the generic writer was introduced (which has now just become the Filled Order token). Writers also didn’t always get a bonus for being used (but we love that they do now don’t we!)

**Governors**

\- Went through a LOT of changes, especially during a specific few weeks near the end of development where both Governors and Governor General went back and forth through different iterations until Cole finally decided on something he was happy with. Some folks miss Governor version 3.0 whereas we settled on 5.0 or whatnot, but where things landed is likely the most streamlined and easier to utilize.

\- This office used to have their own treasuries, get Bonuses during Bonus phase, and could invade. They would due things like tax but decide if they wanted to keep a buck for themselves, request money from the president, commission regiments, quell chaos, and build permanent forts which increased defense or build infrastructure which increased value of orders.

\- Eventually Governors no longer needed money for checks and had a dice value based on the region (indicated on the Gov card) +1 if all orders were open in that region.

**Superintendent of Trade in China**

\- Used to act after Bonus phase. Used to get opened and then had to be filled next turn during hiring, and worked like any Presidency in that it required ships and a treasury to spend for checks. Eventually China was given a jumpstart in that the office was immediately hired upon creation and was given £5 and 2 Extra ships so it could trade that turn. This was ultimately simplified so that it used the number of ships for the check, thus not requiring a treasury.

\- The India board used to have Plantations that would dictate how much money China would make for trading. Each plantation was £4 per plantation. Eventually plantations were swapped out for built Opium Icons on the board. As long as EIC controlled that region those icons counted towards the China trade.

\- The saddest change to this office, which affected the board as well, is the Opium Icon was switched out for an Exported Goods icon. Thematically the opium trade was getting going at this time and the China office is EIC getting that ball rolling with their plantations. Because the game is produced in China, and because China is super sensitive about opium (for obvious reasons) Cole was advised he needed to change the icon as a poppy would cause problems. The opium trading had to be dumbed down to generic exports.

**Governor General**

\- This position went through many tweaks as well, which I don’t really recall entirely. As with the Governors, GG went through a dramatic season of changes until Cole was satisfied. The dice pool that the Governor General utilized was something that eventually made its way over to the Governors.

**Commander-In-Chief**

\- This position used to exist! It was like the Governor General, and even had it’s own law card to create the position. This removed all commanders, replaced Military Affairs, and Commander-In-Chief was now the sole controller of all things related to the army.

**Prime Minister**

\- Prime Minister used to be attainable by simply being the one who had the most votes for a law passing. Eventually the Leader of the Opposition was added, requiring someone to have the most votes against a law that ultimately fails to snipe the PM. Again, something that seems to have been a bit earlier than my experience, but it seems laws were something divvied out to players and the PM could pick in their hand or another consenting player’s hand. There also didn’t used to be pass/fail conditions on laws, but I’m not as familiar with what this looked like (I assume fairly like how laws might have been in first edition, again those who know please chime in!). PM was also not worth Power initially but is now worth 2, good enough reason to try and steal the position in the end game yeah? Though, pro tip, consider that PM position is the ultimate tie breaker for things such as Prestige Card choice and even end game…so either having the position or helping someone closer to your right have the position can be very important.

# The India Map

\- Plantations existed in specific regions and provided the value for China’s trade. Eventually Plantations covered open orders and increased these orders by £5.

\- Order values across the map were tweaked. Some were lowered, others raised (Hyderabad went from £6 to **7).**

\- The number of open orders had a penalty of region strength including empires like when invading.

\- There were specific differences between a rebellion occurring in an EIC controlled region and an invasion from another region coming into our territory. Invasions had to manage the strength of the region/empire, where rebellions were solely the unrest. Eventually a rebellion in one EIC region caused unrest in all the regions. Then unrest was added to the total strength of an invasion as well as being strength for rebellion. Now if the company gets invaded it’s chaos everywhere on the map. There was a lot of small adjustments with how the unrest cubes worked, what they counted towards, and how different crisis events were handled. Some were more difficult to keep straight than others, but things should be considerably more clear now with how there’s basically 3 defined events now (Rebellion, Invasion, or Attack against the Company).

\- The loot system changed many times over for commanders, and the amount of money looted also was altered by changes to the Governor tokens and then adding £4 per tower level to incentivize a greedy invasion against a stronger region.

\- Cascades would simply be ignored or only go so far if they couldn’t be actioned, but Cole decided that cascades should cause cascades and now we’re all aware of how important it is to keep specific orders open as often as possible to avoid horrible things.

\- The Elephant used to move around based solely off the Event deck, but Cole noticed that India wasn’t behaving as dynamically as desired (or as he stated, “India was self-cannibalizing a little too dramatically and I was finding situations with 2 empires (let alone 3) to basically never be happening)…” and thus few changes were made. A - regions used to be capable of Collapse, which would occur if a region needed to remove a tower level but didn’t have one. This caused all orders in the region to close and may have had other implications that I can’t recall. B – Tower level decreased on failed rebellion/invasion instead of whoever was the loser between the crisis. C – Imperial Ambitions was born to provide moment to a successful Invader so they’d move to take over another region instead of the Elephant moving off elsewhere.

\- Obviously there were a number of other changes made to the Event deck itself, balancing out the frequency and types of events, how the Elephant would be directed, and other minute details that Cole would probably need to key you in on to appreciate.

# The Firms

\- Unfortunately, I didn’t jump into the firm game until later on, though I did get to experience one or two large changes to how things were being handled.

\- Deregulation rules changed multiple times, with deregulation being mandatory when the company hit specific spaces on standing or debt (see the green spaces in the older boards).

\- A debtors prison was a fun idea suggested by someone that was added later on, and how/when people could invest in firms shifted around a bit. You used to have to trade company shares 2:1 for firm shares if standing/debt were on what are now striped spaces.

\- Firms used to provide power but eventually were changed to VP based on company value and shares. Before it was anyone who had a share in a firm received the power it was worth I believe. Craziness.

\- The way shares and ships worked in firms went through some adjusting. There wasn’t always a cap on shares if I remember right, and the +1 to ships was added later on to allow for smaller firms a better chance at success. The best change was the way initiative was added with ships minus successes being an indicator on who gets to roll first. This allows smaller firms a chance at success with larger firms existing, as more ships means chances are you might be trading later for half value. These things really evened out the firm game and allowed much more flexibility and viability for different types of firms to exist and function.

\- I suggest anyone who really got to dive into the firm games as it developed chime in and provide insight as I only have so much!

# The Crown

The solo game didn’t change too much over the course of things, as you can see from this preview ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c9NJ-DRI2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c9NJ-DRI2o)). Many changes were due to Ricky needing to keep up with development tweaks to all the many elements of the core game. Overall, the way The Crown runs and behaves stayed the same, with the brilliant Promise Cube system being used as a way to gain leverage and negotiate with the AI. There were changes to promise cube values of course, how much is needed to spend to get The Crown to behave this way, or how much do I gain from doing The Crown this favor. There were also plenty of opportunities to edit or add additional ways for players to interact with her.

Some things were added over the course of testing to ensure things remained balanced and challenging. Little annoyances like players as Chairman needing to give up a cube each round or being forced to give cubes if opening a firm. At one point there were variable VP gained based on how many cubes you had at end of game, but eventually this was done away with. The -VP penalty for company failure was added as a great way to ensure you are working hard to keep the company afloat or have ensured your position can take the hit from company failure cards and the like. The climate of the Crown changed a bit, with things like “anchor” and “bell” being changed to “Fox” and Stag” or however it shook out. The personalities behind these climates remained intact from what I can tell.

Originally The Crown would do everything in her power to gain and keep the Prime Minister position, not caring at all about the laws and simply acting in a way that would obtain or retain PM. Eventually Ricky got fancy and was able to create a dynamic system for The Crown to care about each law depending on climate and circumstance. She would also spend money and votes towards her cause, which was then tweaked to the variable bonus votes based on treasury.

The original Crown Handbook was over 60 pages, basically dedicating an entire section to each climate. You would have a section that was for Bull and it would go from Chairman to China and then the next section would do the same. This was a nice layout, but it was frustrating to jump between the sections based on climate (despite it only changing once per turn) and didn’t allow players to see at a glance what the dynamics were between climates. I will take full credit here and say I spent far too long putting together an alternate handbook with intention to share to BGG that ultimately became the current Crown Handbook. The handbook format/layout as you see it today was what I compiled, copied over by Drew and prettied up and edited as necessary for the final print. I’m incredibly pleased to see that something I had worked hard to make as a benefit to players ended up becoming the official format for how folks will play the game.

One last thing I can think of is the Crown Climate shift itself. I had brought up how it was somewhat frustrating that I could, as Chairman for example, know everything The Crown was intending to do for the round as I figured out treasuries and such. I would know her behavior and desire to act this way or that. I could ensure I didn’t give too much to a Presidency that would fail to act or give her the opportunity to squander cash for something harmful. Ricky had stated he was playing with an idea to give the Crown a little bit more unpredictability. Other than at the start of the game, the only other time you would draw a new AI card was during Parliament Phase to get a new climate and see how The Crown would vote. An additional Climate change was added to the Chairman phase, and cleverly to the beginning if Crown or after if player. This meant that I as Chairman would have to go through the motion of planning the round without knowing exactly what climate I was getting. Great! However, Ricky wanted something a bit more dynamic in the climate shifting and thus the Shift Climate section in the Parliament Phase was made. Ricky went through different iterations on how exactly this played out, but he ultimately settled on what we have now which allows for dynamics based on the company’s standing. This element alone took a bit of work to get down right, mostly to ensure players would perform it properly (I might be the reason the rules clarify “failure + catastrophic failure” when simply saying failure should be enough…).

# The End

This was pieced together from scouring the announcements channel in the Discord and from my own memory and experiences playing the game over the past year and a half. As I said, there are far more experienced players who have spent so many more hours playing this game who can likely provide some great insight (and possibly a few corrections to my info above).

I was lucky to have a friend group who took to this game and allowed us to play dozens of games as testers, and I was fortunate to get to work somewhat closely with Ricky as I focused more of my plays on the solo game with a handful of other awesome people. I’m incredibly excited to see what comes next for Wehrlegig and Ricky, and am looking forward to testing and helping out in anyway I can to make these projects the best they can be.

I encourage those who were along for this journey share your experiences. I’m also happy to answer any other questions the best I can.

boardgames,WSBG Vegas 2022 Review or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Fact that Nobody Knows WTF is Going On,False,225,0,"a short (?), sweet (??), and scathing (!!!) review of my experience in Vegas...

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday: there are two Ring Events this night, 7 Wonders and Splendor; so far, so good, everything seems fairly well-conducted. I check in at the desk at the front of the Tournament Hall and I am given my table and my seat number, all is well and the night proceeds...

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday: my Ring Event this day is Wingspan, 9a start time - I check in at the front desk and I am given my table and my seat number. The ""player board"" tournament template that was introduced by the WSBG organizers started to be exercised, and it gave me some measure of confidence in their interest in conducting a fair and structured event. However, I noted at this time that there was no common game clock: games started when they were ready, and neither judges nor tournament procedures were ever introduced. When we needed assistance it was necessary for somebody from our table to get up and seek out somebody that looked like they might be a ""judge"" (???). Surprisingly, during our first game we were told by somebody who looked like a judge that we had \*\* 4 hours \*\* to complete the first round -&gt; this loose time control will come in to play again later in this review...

&amp;#x200B;

Friday (the cracks begin to show): As I did for the previous two events, I went to the front desk to check in. Somebody who ""looked like a judge"" (recall nobody has ever been formally introduced, they can only be recognized by standing in the right place at the right time wearing what looks like the right shirt) told me to ""go to the back corner of the hall"" for my game. I did so, and then somebody else wearing the right shirt asked me ""did you check in?"" -&gt; to which of course I responded ""no, I was told to come over here"". He then told me to go back to the front desk and check in... so back to the front desk I went, where I was admonished, yelled at and asked ""who told you to come up here? go back to the corner!"" -&gt; ???. I return to the back corner of the hall, somebody new wearing the right shirt shows up and tells everybody to find their name and seat number on a placard on one of the 7 tables and prepare for their game. After everybody finds their seat there are over a dozen players still milling about, confused that they have not been seated. The tournament organizer (?) that I previously mentioned starts reading names, covering all of the players who have not yet been seated, and tells them to step aside and be seated at another group of tables. Then, we are instructed to begin our round when we are ready. It seems like a rather small field, and then we come to find out: of the \~40 players that signed up for the event, for some reason \*\* 13 \*\* players were given a first round bye!! What was supposed to be a 4 round Ring Event (where the winner advances to Sunday's semifinals) was now at best a 3 round event where 1/3 of the field was given a first round bye...

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday, the final day of Ring Events: Dune Imperium

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;&lt; the degraded experience as the days went by prepared me for the s#!t show that was to come, and I was not disappointed &gt;&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Dune: Imperium -&gt; a sold out event (1 of maybe 2?) and arguably the crown jewel of the tournament given the game's popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

The first round was scheduled to start at 3p (already rescheduled twice) and when I arrived to check in I found the doors to the tournament hall closed. I opened the door and walked to the check-in desk.

&amp;#x200B;

“What game are you here for?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Dune”

&amp;#x200B;

“Game start has been delayed, please wait outside the hall and we’ll call you in when we’re ready for you”

&amp;#x200B;

...a sign on the door would have been helpful, but instead they had to make this same statement to at least 30 other people that opened the doors and went inside over the next 45 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

\~45 minutes later somebody wearing what looks like the right shirt comes out and instructs us to start lining up for check-in, again this game is sold out so we’ve got 256 players to get seated at 64 tables.

&amp;#x200B;

Check-in is complete, everybody is seated, but nobody has come around to instruct us how to proceed. After a few more minutes my table decides to reach out to the table next to us and swap game copies with them so we can start getting set up (recall: everybody had to bring their own copy of the game for the Ring Events that they signed up for, and you couldn’t play with your own copy so swapping like this is how it usually went; also note that fewer than half of the players at my tables actually brought copies of the game, so who exactly were these instructions for??).

&amp;#x200B;

My table is all set up, we're chatting, I have a good group of players and I’m feeling like this is going to be an enjoyable session... some more time passes and it looks like literally nobody is in control, besides being given table and seat numbers at check-in we have not received any instruction, so I get up to go find somebody who looks like they are wearing the right shirt to ask when we are starting the round and was told “oh, if you’re ready start now” grrrrr... so we did.

&amp;#x200B;

As the first round of the game starts we are all being very deliberate and taking our time, making sure that we all understand the ""player board"" template rules and deciding upon the conventions we want to establish for ""pieces played / cards laid"" etc. -- During this round a player at our table brings up a rules question and offers what they think the answer is; I agree and I am ready to continue the game, esp. as the question has nothing to do with anything currently happening on the board and was more “what if” based, but 2 other players didn’t agree with the interpretation and wanted a judge ruling at that moment. So our table calls for a judge, one comes over and discusses the rules and chats about where to find a valid ruling as they search through print-outs (rule book vs. published errata vs. BGG Dennen posts etc.) and just generally wastes time that didn’t need to be used at the moment, but whatever... 25 minutes or so go by and we get back to the game and we finish the first round of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

We start the second round of the game and another rules question comes up re: “are discard piles open information?”. I answer “yes of course they are”, a player at our table disagrees and wants a ruling, and this one I’m happy to get officially resolved since it should be quick \*\*and\*\* I know I’m right \*\*and\*\* I intend on using this during the game. A judge comes over and tells us “no, discard piles are not open information” ?!!?. I ask for them to bring another judge over, and after some rule book and errata investigation (along with more unnecessary casual chatting) the second judge decided to rule that “you can look through your own discard pile but not your opponent’s”, arghhhhhh !!!! To which I replied “if that is the ruling that you’re going to hold us to you are going to have a room full of very upset players, because every other player here knows that discard piles are absolutely open information” - but that was that, the ruling was made and we continued our game (another 20+ minutes spent on this unsatisfactorily resolved matter).

&amp;#x200B;

\^ not 10 minutes later I overhear the same question come up at a table in the next row, somebody who looks like a judge appears and immediately rules for that table that “yes, discard piles are open information”... so I guess there’s just different rules at each table ??

&amp;#x200B;

My table begins the third round of the game (for those unfamiliar, this game usually runs 8-9 rounds of play), we are finally looking like all of the B.S. might be behind us and we can get on with playing the game - halfway through the round one of the judges (the same from our first “rules question”) comes over to say “you have less than 40 minutes to finish your game” —— WAT

&amp;#x200B;

“the round ends @ 5:30”

&amp;#x200B;

How can that be, I ask? The round started late, and in fact every table started at different times since nobody told us when to start or what the time controls would be (recall we had 4 HOURS for our 1st round of Wingspan, so it never crossed my mind that time would be an issue here) - in addition, at least 45 minutes of our game time thus far had been wasted by judges who didn’t know what they were doing and seemingly had no problem taking their time and chatting us up using our game time !!

&amp;#x200B;

But that was it, the game ends at 5:30, finish it up - so then everybody at the table tilts, players at my table start yelling at each other, everybody rushing for whatever scraps of points they can get before time runs out, misplays abound (myself included), it becomes a giant clusterF..

&amp;#x200B;

My table is at the beginning of round 7 of the game when the same judge comes by again to tell us “game ends in 10 minutes, at that time finish the round and declare a winner” - at least that’s what I heard, 2 other players at our table heard “game ends in 10 minutes, finish THIS round and declare a winner” which makes considerably less sense, why bother telling us how much time is left if we’re just supposed to finish the current round? So this needed another judge ruling / clarification (and this one was actually necessary, since this absolutely impacts play for the next set of turns) - a few more minutes are wasted, the judge that comes over can’t give us a decisive answer (??) so says “I will go get an answer for you, I’ll be right back” — which doesn’t really help...

&amp;#x200B;

Half of the players at our table want to continue the game in the meantime, certain that this was indeed the last round and playing for the points to make sure they can secure the lead until the end of the round; myself and another player believe we can finish this round and get to the next one before time is called, and of course we both want that ruling as it puts us in the position we want to be in... but in truth nobody knows for sure what is going on at this point, everything is FUBAR

&amp;#x200B;

The round ends, everybody has exhausted their resources / screwed up their plays / tried to position themselves to reach a win condition at the time that they \_believed\_ the game would end.

&amp;#x200B;

The judge comes back and says “don’t worry about the time, just finish the game to completion”.

&amp;#x200B;

...and all hell breaks loose, my table is about to be flipped, \_nobody\_ is happy about this, none of us have reserved the resources or the play options to successfully plan to play this out.

&amp;#x200B;

Each player in our game was convinced they would have won in a different round given a different ruling on when the game was supposed to end...

&amp;#x200B;

Time to breathe, reliving this as I typed it out was fairly traumatic... there is no world in which I would ever do this again with these rank amateurs, this event was so poorly conducted, I feel incredibly duped; they were in no way prepared to succeed at a venture at this scale, despite marketing themselves as if they were; the resources exist in the gaming community that would have made them successful, I do not understand why they did not take advantage of them.

I DO remember that the pieces were generally the size ofy fist at biggest, but mostly slightly smaller. They were plastic and the ""standard"" pieces were Grey while the ""special"" harder pieces were yellow. They were also deceptively weighted/balanced; for example a piece might look like a cone but on closer inspection has uneven angles or is heavier weighted on one side than the other.

Shapes ranged from an egg, to a goblet, to a cone, to some funky cubes/rectangles.

boardgames,Why do so many game publishers not care about uniform card sizes?,False,0,0,"I don't mean that all games should have the same size cards, what I am referring to are individual decks that have cards that are not cut to the same size. It drives me bonkers every time I get a new game, I go to do the first shuffle and I can immediately tell that some of the cards are slightly different size than the others because they will not shuffle, they clump together in little groupings.

This is not something that is relegated to cheap games, expensive games, big publishers or small publishers. I have had this problem with Robinson Crusoe, shards of infinity, many others and today, my daughters new game, Dog Lover. 

I have contacted the publisher's trying to get replacements and I have gotten mainly two responses. The first was what I got from Portal games about Robinson Crusoe. They were really helpful in general, they sent me two or three different replacement deck packs, but I never got all the cards for a deck in the same size. This eventually ended in ""that's just how the game decks are"". The other is what I got from Ultra Pro in regards to Shards of Infinity. They know that the cards are cut wrong and the best they would do was send me sleeves. My step children's dad had already bought the 3 expansions for the game so we needed a lot of sleeves. They ended up sending me about 75% of what I needed to sleve all the cards but refused to send the rest because they had already sent the ""approved amount to send for the situation"".

boardgames,Ready Set Bet has been an absolute hit with my game groups!,False,11,0,"I picked this up last weekend on a somewhat whim. I had heard it mentioned on a podcast but couldn't remember much about it, other than live action horse betting.

I didn't really have anything like it so I said why not; And since then I've played a half dozen times. 
Nobody ever wants to play just once. It's wild and chaotic, and always gets people talking (often shouting). starting out it seems pretty dull and slow, but As soon as bets starts hitting the table the excitement builds and everyone gets into it.

You don't bet money like other games, instead you bet with tokens that will multiple your payout based on how well a horse scores. There's also exotic finishes, prop bets, and side VIP cards for even more options. These other options can kind of be a lot to add for new players, so there is an option to leave those out.

The horses are controlled by one player being the ""house"" and rolling dice to see which horse moves. It also comes with a great app that allows everyone to bet and nobody needs to play the house. It also features an excited commentator who will loudly announce the big changes in the race.

All in all it was a great experience, and so far I've played in groups as small as 2 and big as 5 with people old and young. It plays up to 8 people (9 if someone is playing the house) and I look forward to how hectic it'll be with a full complement of players",,6,,11,,public
boardgames,Basic board game bag? (EU),False,3,0,"EDIT: should have made the title say *backpack* instead of *bag*.

For a while now I've been using a [standard Cajon backpack](https://www.thomann.de/de/sela_se_090_cajon_backpack.htm) to transport a larger amount of games on foot. For 30x30 game boxes or smaller, it's almost as perfect a vessel as can be, except the *slight* issue that it's not made with a 20kg load in mind (3-4 boxes with inserts and expansions and you can easily get there).

Which means that [disintegration](https://imgur.com/a/LCJHacu) is the inevitable result of using it for a while. Now, I'm prety sure this would not have happened if the stitched reinforcing straps went over the edge and connected with each other to distribute the pressure away from that edge, which is a real minor change.

boardgames,[New to Clank!] Does Clank! have a first player balance issue?,False,2,0,"I finally bought Clank! last week, and everyone I played with loved it!

However, a common observation was the fact that usually the first player won. Out of 8 games I played with differenct groups, the first player won 7 times. And out of these 7 times, only once the difference between the highest and the second highest score was less than 10. 

Adding a single extra Clank! at the beginning of the game seems to be the only way to balance the first player advantage. Adding a single Clank! doesn't really seems to make any difference, comparing with the advantages of moving first, and cycle through your discard pile faster.

boardgames,September victory - Pandemic Legacy Season 1,False,8,0,"&gt;!\[edit\] Adding another spoiler warning in case it shows up for some reason in previews as it did for at least one person.!&lt;

&gt;!Text follows.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Start:!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!After a BRUTAL first game in September where our Soldier was revealed to be the traitor and we flamed out spectacularly we picked ourselves up and tried again.  New member of the team - Anita the virologist who loathes the scientist, Fiona.  (Rivals)!&lt;

&gt;!We had an absolutely incredible start.  The one disease we'd fully 'upgraded', black, was not placed at all during the setup infection phase and we had sufficient black cards by turn 2 (scientist) to automatically cure it.  (She needs one fewer, the disease requires one fewer, and no action needed so when she drew her cards and got a third black on top of the two she had to start, it was done.) Amazing.!&lt;

&gt;!But then:  on turns 5, 9 and 13 the first player drew an epidemic card!  We were furiously trying to quarantine and/or remove faded figures - nearly the whole board has faded cities now - and just barely keeping it at bay.!&lt;

&gt;!Eventually we cure yellow, and get enough cards to the scientist - 4 - to cure red, but that's her final action so we have to survive one more go-round.  We've already sabotaged two bases, so all that's left is quarantining 7 cities, so that (plus preventing outbreaks) is our focus now.!&lt;

&gt;!With only I think five cards remaining we finally pull one of our funded events - we used two thanks to losing the previous match - and it was the one permitting the addition of two quarantine markers anywhere.  Incredible timing.!&lt;

&gt;!With that we just barely managed to get to the Scientist, luckily didn't get the fifth epidemic, and win.!&lt;

&gt;!Following the match we have: !&lt;

&gt;!18 cities stable 13 cities unstable 10 cities rioting 3 cities collapsing 4 cities fallen!&lt;

&gt;!Every continent has at least one Faded city except Asia. South America is in the best shape overall (no unstable cities, one faded).   We have no structures in North America any more; Europe has a few but is completely Faded, being the home of city zero (Essen).!&lt;

&gt;!Peeked ahead at October: looks like we're on the hunt for patient zero!  Thinking we need the operations specialist as we've lost a lot of structures to our own sabotage and of course rioters tearing down research labs!!&lt;

&gt;!Such a great game.  We're loving it.    Thirteen games over seven months to get to this point.!&lt;

&gt;!One thing I have found really interesting is that we are 50/50 win-loss with zero funded events in the deck.  Except our first game that we completely screwed up, we are 100% wins with any funded events in the deck.!&lt;

boardgames,What game is the shining example of each particular mechanism and why?,False,0,0,"Curious to see what people think are the best examples of a mechanism and why. Doesn't have to be the best game, but that particular mechanism was implemented perfectly.

* Deck Building
* Engine Building
* Tableau Building
* Action Selection
* Worker Placement
* Drafting
* Take That
* Simultaneous Action
* Bluffing
* Resource Management
* Set Collection
* Anything else?

For example, I think **Clank!** does *deck building* very well because of how well it's interconnected with other mechanics in the game. The cards determine movement, purchasing power, attack, and other effects which makes the decisions interesting. It's easy to feel like you have to spend everything each turn or you're wasting resources, but it could also lead to bloating your deck. However, my fav deck building is Slay the Spire (video game) and I've yet to find a board game that creates the same feeling of deck optimisation and combos. I wish **Clank!** had some more options to thin your deck.

For *tableau building* I love **Race for the Galaxy** (digital, haven't played the physical) because the combination of things in your tableau really matter - as in you literally can't win without having a coherent strategy for the things you build. The game also has fantastic pace, but I'm not sure if that's because the digital version makes it so fast.

As an *engine builder*, I love **Space Base**. It's incredibly satisfying building up a few numbers and then pointing your other numbers to your core numbers to get massive production on the right rolls. It makes the end of the game feel like you've really built an engine because you're accomplishing so much more than the beginning of the game - that feeling of progression is fantastic.

*Worker placement* is one I've had trouble enjoying. **Viticulture** doesn't do it for me despite how well it's reviewed, and the **Century** version with worker placement falls flat for me too (would much prefer the original). I do like **Lost Ruins of Arnak**, but I don't think it's the *worker placement* necessarily that is good - it's just how well balanced everything is (of which *worker placement* is one mechanism).",,10,,0,,public
boardgames,WILDTAILS (Legacy Tails of Baritaria) Review - Buttonshy Legacy Card Game!!,False,1,0,"(Full video review here: https://youtu.be/h4y_3FkUXh8)

Ahoy there folks! For this week's video, I thought I'd break the trend with something a little more unscripted, a little more what's happening now. As such I'm going to be talking to you all about WILDTAILS - A Pirate Legacy; a pirate themed legacy resource management game for 1-2 players from Buttonshy games.

First of all, let me introduce you to Buttonshy games, if you don't already know about them. These guys make fantastic games using only eighteen cards, that come in these dinky little wallets, much like the ones you'd use for your train pass. We already have Skulls of Sedlec and Sprawlopolis, which I'll cover in future videos.

So what makes WILDTAILS so special? Well, firstly, it's a pirate game, and if you watched my review of LOOT, you'll know how I feel about pirate games.

Secondly, it's a Legacy game. No really. It's a Legacy Game, with only eighteen cards.

For those of you who don't know, Legacy games, like Pandemic Legacy or Risk Legacy, are games that evolve and change from round to round permanently altering the game. Depending on how you do, you may permanently modify the board, add new rules or cards, or even remove and destroy cards entirely. This means your next game session is going to be different and it feels like the game is evolving around you.

But again, to be able to do this kind of experience with only eighteen cards sounded frankly ludicrous. When I first heard about it through a friend on the boardgames Subreddit, I was a little dubious. Kind of like a treasure map found in a random bottle floating by. I contacted the guys at Buttonshy, and I've been beta testing the game for a week or so now and it REALLY holds up.

The basic premise of WILDTAILS is that you're aiming to build your own pirate empire in the semi-fictional American south following a story campaign of ten chapters.

The decisions you make throughout the campaign do affect the outcome, and also modify which new rules unlock on certain cards. As the campaign progresses, you'll unlock new abilities for your pirates, enhance your empire and even unlock a fleet fairly early on. You'll also get to choose new abilities for the characters as the game progresses and, without spoiling anything, the decisions you make can, and will make certain chapters more or less difficult.

So how does it actually play?

Basic gameplay involves you attempting to complete two objectives, before driving off that scenarios Threat, which could be Raiders, or even the bloody British Navy. You do this by taking actions each turn to complete scenes, attack the threat to keep it under control, or using character abilities and honestly, the way this all works is a little ingenious.

Besides the playable characters, the Empire card, and the reference card, every card in the game is having an identity crisis and is a Scene on one side of it, and then either an Objective or a Threat on the other. These cards also have FOUR different resources around the edges.

One of the most common actions you'll do on your turn is to interact with the current Scene card, completing one of the four tasks shown on it, hiring crew, pillaging the governor's manor, or... Robbing graves???

One of these tasks is usually free. Two have costs involved to achieve them, and the fourth usually involves a skill check to complete. When you complete a task on a Scene, you find which of the four edges shows the resources rewarded, and slip it under your character.

Cool, right? I love how they've managed to get so much done with so few cards!

In future turns, these resources can be used to pay for other tasks, or for interacting with various special abilities.

To make a skill check, you first reference the relevant ability on your character sheet, then reveal the scene below the current Scene for its modifier. You add this modifier to your character ability and if it matches or exceeds the requirement, the check was successful. Huzzah, pop open the rum, you're awesome.

Special note should be made that if the two Scenes ""Curse"" symbols match, it's an automatic failure, which adds a little tension even on easier checks, which I really like, even if it has dashed some of my best laid plans against the rocks of inadequacy.

If you fail a Skill Check, the scene is discarded, if you succeed, you earn the rewards.

At the end of each of your turns, you can also store cards under your empire card for other characters to hopefully use, thanks to the Smuggle action.

The second most common action is completing objectives. To complete a scenario, you must complete both objectives fully, then chase away the Threat.

To complete an objective, you must pay resources matching it's completion criteria. The first time this happens, you'll slide the objective under your character where it now provides permanent abilities and modifiers. As you complete the objective again and again, these cards slide up giving further rewards and abilities.

Again, how cool is this? This card was a Scene, four different resources, and an Objective, now it's a tracker giving you additional stuff each turn!

You'll ultimately need to complete each objective four times to get the final ability to line up so that you can finally chase away the threat and complete the scenario.

That, in a nutshell, is the main gameplay loop, making decisions, gathering resources, and completing the two objectives before beating the Threat. But there are a number of rubs and twists to really spice things up, like a bar fight at Tortuga.

Firstly, the threats don't sit idly watching your game, waiting to be taken out. They are called THREATS, after all.

Once the Scene deck depletes the first time, you'll reshuffle the discard pile to make a new Scene deck, then the Threat will capture one of the scenes, making the Threat tougher to beat and thinning the Scene deck a little. Then the Threat advances, using the Pirate's Log reference card as a convenient marker.

Now, the Curse symbols on the scenes suddenly gain a new use. At the start of a turn, if the Scene's curse marker matches any of the Curse Markers lined up on the Pirate's Log, then the relevant Threat affect triggers. This can involve capturing more Scenes, losing resource cards and more. These effects can really throw a cutlass into the works.

The more resource cards you hold, or are captured by the Threat, the faster the rounds go and the quicker it all ramps up. The trick is to use your resources quickly and efficiently, and try to effectively manage the threat by attacking it.

If you ever run out of Scene cards, or if the Threat captures five cards, or if you reach the end of the seventh round, the game ends in a failure.

Attacking the threat is the third action you can do on your turn, and involves making a Skill Check against the threat, increasing the requirements based on the number of cards the threat has currently captured. Whether you fail or pass this skill check, the current Scene is discarded. If you do manage to succeed, however, you smack the Threat upside the face, or some other equally heroic action, and all the captured Scenes are discarded. The Threat remains, and doesn't decrease in any other way, but you have those all important Scene cards back in the game for future rounds, and the Threat is easier to beat in future.

If you've completed both your objectives and have those final symbols lined up, it now means the Threat can be permanently defeated. Succeeding now will chase the Threat away and win the game.

The way that the Threat escalates throughout the game by adding more and more troublesome curse abilities, by stealing cards out of the Scene deck to speed up rounds, and getting stronger the more it captures really adds a sense of growing tension to the game that I really wasn't expecting.

This results in some really unnerving situations where you feel like you're racing against the clock. Doing whatever you can to keep pushing your objectives, whilst juggling an ever growing Threat really ups the ante in ways I wasn't expecting, and knowing that winning or losing scenarios changes the course of the story made for a really fun experience.

Now, some cooperative games absolutely suck to lose. Whilst I'm a fan of the Dark Souls boardgame, spending half an hour to set up a game that you play for three hours then lose, feels awful, and honestly, it's a real hard sell to go again. WILDTAILS? Screw it. Resetting takes seconds, and each scenario takes around 10-15 minutes, give or take any action paralysis.

Ultimately, eventually you'll reach the end of the campaign victorious, add up your score based on how you did through the game's four Acts, and get a final score. And normally, that's where a Legacy game ends. The board has been mutilated, cards destroyed, stickers all over the shop, and that's the experience.

Not so with WILDTAILS!

Once the campaign is over, you can continue to use your upgraded cards in post campaign one-shot scenarios. This was something I wasn't expecting and are still really cool!

You play with two random objectives, and a random Threat, and this can make for some really interesting scenarios not seen in the campaign. Obviously, your characters are fully upgraded at this point, and there's no way to undo any of the decisions you made that altered the cards, but this just means your version of post-campaign WILDTAILS is going to be different to other folks.

I was worried that playing post-campaign with fully upgraded characters and randomised objectives and threats could make things really hit or miss, but whilst there are definitely easier and harder setups, none ever felt unfair, but none ever felt smooth sailing either.

And remember, this is a Buttonshy game. Most of their current games are around the $12 range, with cheaper print and play options. Honestly, I expect WILDTAILS to be slightly more expensive due to a few extra components - mainly the sticker sheets - but even then, the value is astonishing, and for something that fits in your wallet and can be played in a space less than a square foot, I wouldn't mind picking up a few copies to go through a few times with friends.

And if you're happy to print and play, well, you can just keep printing new sets.

As much as I loved going through Pandemic Legacy the first time, the price tag makes it less appealing for replays, and there's no way to really play it after the campaign concludes short of trying to peel off stickers and using Tipex to erase whatever you've written on the board. It's a large pricetag for a shared experience and whilst it's absolutely wonderful, it definitely feels more like a one and done.

WILDTAILS has that inbuilt post-campaign playability, and going through the campaign again is only a minor investment.

Now, I'm using a prototype print and play supplied by Buttonshy here, using greyscale artwork and some filler graphics. The finished product will be full colour, and printed on proper card stock as you'd expect.

But even in greyscale, the artwork is gorgeous. The Scenes are lively and detailed, and I absolutely adore the animorphic characters. Seriously, if there's anything I love more than pirates, its Saturday Morning Cartoon pirates. Being Jack Sparrow is cool, but being Jack The Sparrow is even cooler. At least to me.

Honestly, if I have any complaint against the prototype, it's that the rules can be a little confusing to get your rum addled head around at first. Understanding that cards essentially have two or three uses each is the first hurdle. It's a Scene card, unless it's being used as a Threat card or an Objective card, or maybe even a Resource Card.

But once you understand this, the game is quick to set up and play, as you'd expect from Buttonshy, and a great fun experience.

Honestly, my journey with WILDTAILS started with me dubious that a legacy game could be done with eighteen cards, let alone be fun, but Buttonshy have once again proved their game design chops and crafted something genuinely fun, unique, and astonishing.

When this one launches, to me, it'll be a no brainer to add to our crew of games. It's small, cheap, and endlessly replayable. Until then, I'll keep playing games with my prototype deck.

If you enjoy pirate themes, and tense resource management, this game could be for you. If you give it a try, let me know in the comments. Otherwise, happy sailing, and see you all next time!",,0,,1,,public

boardgames,Betrayal at House on the Hill Question: How do you use the laundry chute tile?,False,13,0,"Okay, my friends and I have the 3rd edition of Betrayal at House on the Hill. We’re in a heated debate over the laundry chute tile. It reads “Leads to the Basement Landing. If you end your turn on this tile, place your explorer on the Basement Landing.” 

One group reads it as this… The “leads to the basement landing” part implies you can use this to get to the basement anytime. If you run out of movement and end your turn on the laundry chute, you place your explorer in the basement without a choice. So if you’re exploring new tiles and you use your last movement speed to discover the laundry chute tile, since your character landed on the chute, they have to go to the basement. They fall down it essentially. 

If you have plenty of movement speed and discover the laundry chute tile, you can choose to jump down it and continue exploring the basement. You’re only forced to do it if you meet the condition of being out of movement. 

One group reads it as this… The laundry chute leads to the basement, but you can only go down it if you end your turn on that tile. So if you have 3 movement speed left, you can’t go down the laundry chute, but if you use up your movement and land on the tile, you’ll go to the basement. “If you end your turn on this tile, place your explorer on the basement landing.” The only time the condition is met and you can use the laundry chute is if you end your turn on that tile. 

Does it make more sense that you can only go down a laundry chute if you end your turn there or does it make more sense that you can go down a laundry chute anytime as a one way ticket down and if you end your turn there, since you’re out of movement speed you’re forced to fall down? 

Considering barriers, movement impairments from enemies, limited tiles leading to the basement. Which is more balanced?",,27,,13,,public

Spoilers follow!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**CAMPAIGN WITH WIFE:**
She played Daisy (cluer) and I played Roland (fighter). The first scenario went swimmingly, with our team netting 6 experience points each by the end. The second scenario was definitely a step-up in difficulty. We were only able to interrogate two cultists (almost a third) before midnight struck. We played the third scenario last night, and it was a disaster. I pulled both of Roland's weaknesses in the first few rounds, and then all of the leftover cultists showed up. The end boss arrived, and we had little chance of winning. I had Lita in my deck, but she was three cards from the bottom.

Not going to lie, it was pretty discouraging. If you don't throw Lita at the baddie, you have to whittle away at his 14 HP, all while trying to deal with his 6 evade, or you get slammed with 3 dam/hor *every round*.

**CAMPAIGN WITH BROTHER:** He plays Skids (fighter build) and I play Wendy. I play through the campaign with my wife first, so that we can experience the shocks and surprises of the story together. With my brother, our games are always better because I know what to expect. We wrecked the first scenario and interrogated 3 cultists (almost 4) in the second. We haven't played the third yet.

**CONCLUSION:** The third scenario wasn't just tough, it honestly seemed fairly impossible if you don't draw Lita early in the scenario. We were SO excited about the game and loved the first two scenarios, but that third one is so poorly balanced that it took the wind out of our sails. I'm really reconsidering spending the $70 for the Dunwich campaign, especially because I've heard from other posters that it's easy to get behind the first scenarios and crash and burn mid-campaign.

boardgames,Alternate way to end Lords of Vegas? Thoughts?,False,5,0,"So me and some friends all played Lords of Vegas for the first time last night. Fun game. But we didn’t love the mechanic of how the game ending was time based as opposed to score benchmark based. Now, we’ve only played it once, so I wanted to hear yalls opinions about this who have played it way more. The issue was one player was WAYYYY ahead as we approached the 3/4 mark, turning the game into a situation where there was no real chance of a comeback and thus greatly diminishing the fun for the last 4 turns or so. Is this a rarity? Is it just because we admittedly were playing pretty badly strategy wise since it was everyone’s first time? We were brainstorming about doing something like getting rid of the game over card and instead playing to a set number (70 or so) and then just going through the deck and reshuffling if we reached the end. Has anyone played like that before? Would love yalls thoughts on this. Thanks guys!",,14,,5,,public

boardgames,Using fictional themes to explain abstract game mechanisms,False,5,0,"Fantasy, sci-fi, and other fictional themes are often used to help explain abstract game mechanisms that don't feel relatable to the real world. **Small World** does a great job of using familiar fantasy races to help you understand and remember some abstract abilities. 

On the other hand, some fictional games fall into the trap of inventing thematic jargon to make the game feel more unique, but it can actually make it harder to understand the game. For example, I found **Cerebria: The Card Game** difficult to grasp because of the terminology. Key words like ""Embrace"" ""Vibes"" and ""Emotion"" don't help me understand how the game mechanisms work.

boardgames,Good table under $1k?,False,28,0,"So I received my Jasper table last week, and it was riddled with issues unfortunately. So much so that I am actually returning the table. I won't go into details, and I know plenty of people have bought them without any issues, but unfortunately my experience wasn't the same.

I don't want to disparage Board Game Tables, they have been very kind and helpful in the return process and they are a small business, I'm sure getting tables to people across the US is difficult and I commend them for even trying. And I say take my experience with the Jasper with a grain of salt - after all, I did plenty of research before buying a Jasper and the sheer number of positive reviews made it seem like a really safe choice. And it definitely still is, I think I just got rather unlucky.

That experience made me rethink the entire concept of paying so much for a table. I decided paying a massive premium due to the niche nature of board game tables as a product just isn't worth the possible hassle if the QC/shipping gamble doesn't go your way. I was concerned about longevity of the table pretty much the moment I opened the box, which isn't promising from a $1.5k product. Again, this isn't the norm from my research, I just got unlucky.

Anyways: Anyone have any non-board-game table recs? Honestly I've just been looking at IKEA since I live close to one. Used to have a Bjursta from there that I actually quite liked, but sadly they discontinued that table it looks like. But I'm open to any recs from anywhere.

boardgames,"Weekend Play Report (3 new to me games, 2 oldies)",False,7,0,"My mother-in-law was up this past weekend so I was able to sneak off to a friends house for the weekend, at least until I was called back due to a sick child. I was able to fit in 8 games though, so not too bad for a trip. 4 were completely new (thought it was 3 when I wrote the subject, a rookie mistake), 2 were oldies, and two got played twice. Here's the breakdown:

1. Vengeance (Played at 2 players and 3 players)

The non-roll and write Vengeance was an absolute delight. It comes in 3 parts, a one-time set collection draft (which is later supplemented in other rounds but the draft happens only once), a dice draft and buy phase, and a roll and attack phase. Each part would be kind of meh, but the sum definitely exceeds the individual parts on their own. The decision of how much damage you take prior to going into a Den; the fun of taking turns where you turn a knife into a gun into a run into two knives and everyone is now dead; the laughs that come with each success and failure; its just all so good. Its one of the few games I found myself rooting for my opponents with each die roll. I will say two bad things about it though: 1) the Rulebook is absolutely terrible and 2) It was a bit more sloggy at 3 compared to 2, but not so much that I wouldn't play again at 3, I probably would pass at 4. Finally, I created the following head-cannon: This is a competitive game because all the vengeance-seekers are sitting at a bar recounting the story of their exploits, and the best story gets free drinks for the night from the others.

2. Street Masters (Played at 2 and 3)

Continuing the theme of beating people up, I found a copy of Street Masters (which was very very tough to do) since it was my friends Birthday and he loves Sentinels but has all that content. It was a good decision, because it played like a Sentinels tactics game, but not like Sentinels Tactics, which was a terrible game. Each turn you move, play a card, and activate a card (or move again, or interact, you get the point). Then the enemy and environment does some things, wash rinse repeat until enough things have been punched. It does feel at times the enemy minions become overwhelming, but we had a good time with it. We won the first at 2, lost when we later played at 3 after knocking out 2 of the bosses 3 health bars. The head-cannon here is if it says 25p (aka per player), each 25 health is a health bar. Of course this has absolutely no effect on gameplay, but if you're going to pretend to be in a side scrolling beat-em-up, you give the boss fake health bars.

3. Flamecraft (Played at 2)

Flamecraft was...fine. On the positives, the game is absolutely beautiful and it plays as a breezy worker placement game. Each turn you take your Dragon miniature, go to a shop, collect the resources showing and then activate a power there. Alternatively, you can go to a shop and cast an enchantment to activate every dragon there. So far so good. My issues are the following: 1) One Dragon seems insanely overpowered, the diamond dragon that lets you collect 3 different resources. Combined with the Potion dragon that swaps and uses and other dragon, we were constantly bouncing these diamond dragons around, filling our coffers with 6-9 resources after casting an enchantment. It seemed like every other dragon mattered much much less since you could use the diamond dragons to use enchantment turn after enchantment turn. 2) More problematic is the end game, where once end game is triggered, everyone gets 1 more turn. This leads to the situation that if first player triggers end game, they get one more turn than everyone else. Given there's not much differentiation between player turns, an extra turn is a huge huge advantage. I'm curious if anyone else had this issue, because it put a real sour taste in my mouth.

4. So Clover (2)

I'm curious why So Clover, when every other board game lists as wide of a player count as possible, when with a minimum 3 players on the box when it so easily plays at 2. We made our clovers, traded, filled out each others clovers, did the check round, and filled it out a second time. A quick fun time, and I will forever call shoes Sock Devices from now on.

5. Long Shot, the Dice Game (3)

The first non-new to me game, Long Shot continues to be fantastic. Roll the dice, place your bets, buy some horses, start yelling at the 6 horse for not moving forward for the 3rd turn in a row despite you betting the house on it WHY WONT YOU MOVE FORWARD. Anyway, the second play of this game, first at 3, and it once again came down to a neck and neck race for 3rd deciding the winner, which had everyone sweating and laughing around the table. Cant wait to play this one again.

6. Dominations (3)

Dominations is technically not new to me, but it came out right before the pandemic so this is an out of the dust play. I'm a huge fan of the game, so I was thankful to get it to the table. In this game, you place some tiles, collect your resources, and buy a tech which you add to a eventually quilt of cards. Honestly, Dominations should be called Tapestry and Tapestry should be called Dominations, but that's a discussion for another day. This game I went heavy on influence and eked out a 1 VP win (which is more impressive when you consider VP are usually 200-300+ points), 2nd place when a mix of monuments and end of age scoring, and third place was within 20 and went heavy monuments. The one drawback of the game is the massive amount of techs you can choose leading to possible AP or downtime. We dodge downtime by letting others go while someone choose a tech, but we had turns where someone would place a tech and then be told its their turn on the tile placement again. That should lessen the more you play the game though. Honestly, one of my favorite games I played this past year.

After Dominations I got called home to help with sick kids, so a few games like Clash of Cultures, Townsfolk Tussle or My City had to stay in the bad, but here's the Tl;Dr tier list:

Long Shot

Dominations

boardgames,New Shop Owner,False,226,0,"You may remember a bunch of months back (January to be exact), someone posted up a Game Cafe for sale for $20,000 (and take over loans) up in Saskatoon.

No, I didn't buy into that. :) 

But I did bring it up with the owner of my FLGS. We discussed the issues with renting board games and table space and providing food. At one point, he mentioned that while he wasn't looking to sell, if he did it would be to me.

I've known him since before he started his shop 10 years ago and he was my Best Man at my wedding a few years back. He and his wife have come to our house for drinks and gaming and we've been to theirs. So we have history.

We started the discussion then. What would it take? How much would you want? Hmmm.

My wife and I discussed it and we looked at our finances and opened serious discussions with him and his wife to see if there was interest. Turns out she was running the business part and he was running the retail part, dealing customers and ordering inventory. There was a third person doing the tech part. Trying out email campaigns, twitter, facebook, and shop gear. Her career was taking off and getting away from the business would let her focus more on her career. The tech guy also had a job and no investment in continuing the tech side of things (everything was pretty old or unused).

As time went on it firmed up and lawyers got involved to create the appropriate documentation. We got asset lists created including the things he wanted to keep. I applied for sales tax licenses for my LLC and we signed papers in August. As of September 1st, all of the assets of the store were mine. Note I didn't buy the LLC, just the assets of the shop which are all now under my LLC.

For the past month I've been taking over control of distributor accounts, facebook, twitter, google, and other accounts that had been started but never completed. I added accounts with game shops like Leder Games, Stonemaier, Steve Jackson, and CMON. Purchased a new computer for the POS. Upgraded the POS. Fixed the security systems. And done some rearrangement of the shop. I restarted board game night (Wednesday nights) and October is Halloween themed with Elder Sign tonight. My wife and I gamed every Wednesday. Now we just go to the shop Wednesday nights :) 

The shop didn't have much in the way of social media presence. I've upped the posting to Facebook and our engagement is over 300% over the past 30 days. I've posted a bit more to Twitter and now have 44 followers (it hadn't been posted to since 2015). I created a discord server that has 75 users after 6 weeks.

I've basically improved the presence but haven't made any changes to the running of the shop leaving it all to my manager. It's been a successful shop for 10 years so I have no reason to muck with that :)

Humorously I got a minor talking to because I was buying my own merch. He knows I'm a collector type and he wants me to let him know what I want as my purchases skews the desire for the product by customers.

In a few years I'll retire and take over the counter. Well, maybe. We'll see how the next couple of years shake out. I may be better at running the business and he needs a job :D

boardgames,A solo dungeon crawler round-up,False,30,0,"I have sunk an embarrassing amount of time into playing roguelike video games, along with dungeon crawlers. There's something about the challenge they promise along with the difficult but rewarding gameplay that really, truly draws me in. Since switching to playing more solo games I've been searching out different dungeon crawling board games so as to try and get that same experience from a tabletop game. Knowing that a number of people are in this together with me, I thought it might be fun to have a look at the games I've tried so far. Hop along, shall we?

I looked at the following games, arranged by after market prices:  
1. One-card Dungeon  
2. Tin Helm  
3. Mini Rogue  
4. Tiny Epic Dungeons  
5. Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion  
6. Space Hulk fourth edition  

And technically Mage Knight, more on that at the end.

What you'll notice is that I don't play very many massive affairs with long Kickstarter wait times and boxes full of miniatures. I'm finding it very difficult to explain to myself why I would buy a 100+ euro game without having absolute certainty that I will get enjoyment out of the game equal to the value that I've put into it. There's some games on this list (specifically Mage Knight and definitely Space Hulk) that most definitely fall into this category, but I could explain those purchases to myself. Mage Knight I bought second-hand for an excellent price before I dove into the Ultimate Edition, and I had played Space Hulk a ton of times before buying my own copy. What I'm saying is that a game has to do a lot more as a value proposition before I will consider buying it the more expensive it is. 

With that note out of the way, let's get started! 

**One Card Dungeon** - 3 plays
What is it:  
One Card Dungeon is pretty much what it says on the tin - a dungeon crawler that's played on a single card. Both players and enemies are dice being moved around, and your actions each turn come from you assigning dice values to your attributes. Make it through twelve dungeons (done by flipping and rotating the dungeon card) to win!  

Would I recommend it:   
Not really, or more as a novelty. One Card Dungeon is very impressively designed, mostly in that the designers managed to make the enemies in the game feel and behave differently from one another just by tweaking some numbers - it really is impressive. That said, I don't think the game has a lot of replay value after you've made it through a few runs. The dungeon lay-out is the same each time, which is not necessarily a big deal if it wasn't for the fact that you see each floor six times in a single run. Added to that is the fact that the dice-driven gameplay leads to a bunch of dead turns where you only really block and hope to find an attack die that does something next turn. It *is* cheap though, so it might just be worth it to you even if you only really get three plays out of it.  

**Tin Helm** - 7 plays  
What is it:   
Tin Helm is the mint tin version of Iron Helm, available only through the Game Crafters. You play as an adventurer delving through a dungeon in search of relic shards that help you break the curse that... Eminates from this place. You'll be combining the front of one card with the back of another to figure out what terrible stuff will befall you in this dungeon. Throw in some dice chucking and you've got a stew going, baby.  

Would I recommend it:   
Partially I would. I most like this game when the result of the flip is largely unknown. The tension in the game really started to dissipate once I started remembering which cards have things on them that give you shards. However, playing the game is a lot of fun! The dice play and stat management is a whole lot of fun, and the push your luck element of figuring out if a room is better as your destination or as the modifier was really clever. My current hope is that the creator figures out a way to make an expansion for this game like he did for Gate, because I'm definitely not tired of the system.   

**Mini Rogue** - 17 plays  
What is it:  
Mini Rogue is a roguelike dungeon crawler in which you explore different floors of either a tower or a dungeon, getting into fights with bosses along the way. Exploring is done by flipping cards on a 3x3 grid, and getting experience unlocks extra dice to use for checks and combat. Throw in a smattering of unique characters, and that's Mini Rogue!  

Would I recommend it:   
I would! Mini Rogue is about as much fun as you can get from a game this light. The characters and character powers are fun, the game is diverse enough and quick enough to get you into a game quickly and get back out, and the character progression feels real good. That said, I will admit that I tired of the base game after quite a few plays because I kept seeing the same few things over and over again. The expansion stuff for the game helped breathe new life into it for me (especially the new characters - that skeleton guy is rad as hell) but after the amount of plays I've had with it I'm looking for new things. That said, it's a very solid game. I've had a ton of fun with it.  

**Tiny Epic Dungeons** - 4 plays  
What is it:  
The Tiny Epic series is known for cramming a ton of game into a little box filled with stellar production values, and the same is true here. This box in particular has a large number of room tiles that you explore in a 7x7 grid space on the look for mini bosses before you can fight the main boss. Players will acquire loot along the way (including loot sets that grow more powerful the more pieces of the set you have) and pilot their heroes in a fight to beat the boss!  

Would I recommend it:    
This is a tough one for me. I personally like it, but the rules for the game are a bit of a mess and the heavy reliance on iconography makes the game hard to parce. I've never beaten the game so far (which I see as a good thing) but I've also consistently had the feeling that I wasn't playing correctly anyway. The boss fight mechanics are weird as heck and I keep forgetting to take damage whenever I reveal a tile with a monster on it. There's also some weird stuff going on with the expansion and the production of the game. I'm not entirely sure that I like the use of both meeples and miniatures in this game, mostly because the meeples look *so good*. The miniatures are not bad, but I'm not sure they add enough to the game. I more feel like they detract from the game rather than adding much; my suspicion is that they were added because many famous dungeon crawlers use minis and so now they feel they had to (looking at you, Gloomhaven). So, if you want a really tough solo or co-op game while being able to deal with weird production choices and unclear rules, I think you can have a lot of fun with this game. It really does have a LOT of game inside that small box.   

**Gloomhaven - Jaws of the Lion** - 9 plays  
What is it:  
Younger brother to the number one boardgame on BGG, Jaws of the Lion is a more streamlined and beginner friendly gateway to the Gloomhaven system. Players will pick a character and play through a 25 part story in which they level up, encounter events and just beat up a ton of monsters. Combat is done through a thrilling multi-use card system in which played combine two halves of two cards to perform their turn. Add in some hidden goals, deck optimization and a dash of openable boxes, and that's Jaws of the Lion.  

Would I recommend it:    
I do in general, but I'm personally not sold on Gloomhaven as a solo game. I truly love the game as a cooperative experience, mostly because there's nothing quite like it. There's absolute magic in a Gloomhaven turn going tits up that you don't really get in other games, and that facet of the game is fully missing once you introduce perfect information. The solo game is most commonly played by controlling two characters, and to me it really erases the magic that is Gloomhaven. However, if you like the combat system in Gloomhaven and enjoy just doing each turn in that game perfectly, you can't really go wrong. The story is mostly disposable, but the encounters and dungeons are really fun and the design going into each of those encounters is second to none.  

Also, I do want to say that I mind the mixing of miniatures and standees in Gloomhaven a lot less than the mixing of minis and meeples in Tiny Epic Dungeons. I am biased towards meeples over minis, but that aside; the separation of player miniatures and enemy standees helps you quickly parce the board and analyze the board in a way that you don't really get in TED. Maybe it's just a matter of scale, or maybe it's just my heart screaming for gorgeous unique meeples. All I know is that I liked the mix in Gloomhaven and actively disliked it in TED.  

Also also, full disclosure; I've gotten rid of my copy of Jaws of the Lion. I can see myself getting rid of some of the other games on this list in the future, but this is the only game that I have actually gotten rid of at this point in time.  

**Space Hulk fourth edition** - 4 plays (solo)  
What is it:  
""Not a solo game and not a dungeon crawler!"" I hear you yell at your screen. Let me get back to you on that. Before we deal with that though; Space Hulk is a game in which you play a group of genetic super soldiers (Space Marines) who are working through different scenarios in order to complete goals in an attempt to fend off a group of alien super killers (Genestealers). Each side of the conflict uses asymmetric rules and powers to try and crush the other side through some fast and quick dice chucking.  

Would I recommend it:  
So here's the deal. I will recommend Space Hulk to anyone who can get their hands on an affordable copy. Compare Space Hulk to the other games we've discussed here, and you'll see many similarities; grid movement, surviving waves of enemies, coordinating a small group of units. Along with that of course comes the fact that Space Hulk is a fantastic game, both two player and solo. The production value of this game is absolutely bonkers, with the thickest cardboard pieces I've ever seen and the fantastic miniatures that have long been Games Workshop's bread and butter. When it comes to the solo game I personally prefer playing both sides with me trying to win as the Space Marines, although you can find formerly official rules in the BGG files section. I really love how tense and difficult it is to win this game as the Marines, and how much fun it is to try and drink every part of their milkshake as the Tyranids.  

However, I can't in good conscience tell people to go search out a 300 dollar game just to play solo. There's no sense in that. So, either make damn sure that this is *your game* before selling a kidney for a fresh copy.  

**Let's talk about Mage Knight**:  
So for me, Mage Knight is the ultimate version of what I'm looking for in a roguelike dungeon crawler. Except of course for one thing; it's technically not a dungeon crawler. The world isn't a dungeon and you get to basically move around wherever you want. Besides that though, I really do think that there's no game like it when it comes to character progression, power escalation and that good power fantasy that I see most other games on this list try to approach in their own way. Really, give the game a chance. It's good.  

**Conclusion**:  
Bang for your buck, I feel that you're going to get a more rewarding experience out of most of the more expensive boxes, although there's a bunch of creative stuff happening in the cheaper boxes. When it comes to depth of gameplay and replayability though, Gloomhaven and Mage Knight take the cake. If you want the most game for the lowest price, I would personally recommend Mini Rogue over the other options (although Tiny Epic Dungeons is not far behind). This genre is probably the most fun I've had playing a solo game, and I can't wait to find out what else there is for me to explore.  

Also, feel free to leave suggestions and recommendations in the comments! If it's affordable I'll definitely try and check it out.",,28,,30,mage-knight,public

EDIT: I didn't realize I should have given some reviews or a tier list.  I'll make sure to add some thoughts to this post later tonight.  

Alright, here's my top 10 and bottom 5.  I got 3/4ths of the way through compiling a very in-dept response, but my computer crashed and I lost it all.  That in mind, I'll keep some of this pretty short - but I'm happy to expand on my thoughts. 


**TOP TEN:**

**Wingspan** – I like this because it is a slow to medium paced game where you have to make difficult and crucial decisions each round.  Your Engine will be different each time, and there are a ton of strategies to try out.  It also does not really feel like a competitive game even though it is, and I like that I can basically just focus on what I’m doing.  It’s almost like putting together a puzzle next to someone doing the same.  The expansions are not necessary, but I do recommend them.  The Europe one adds a lot of cards, and the Oceania expansion adds cards in addition to a new resource/mechanic.

**Radlands** – I can’t stress enough how much I love this game.  It is a competitive card game based on destroying your opponents three bases, while protecting your own.  Each game feels like an epic tug-of-war of attrition.  Every time I think I’m about to win, my opponent takes a turn and completely takes the wind out of my strategy.  It’s a game that forces you to be aware of everything on each board, and to adapt quickly when things go wrong.  I’m not sure if it is the production value that draws me in so much (I have the version with the playmats and chunky plastic tokens), or the constant emotional rollercoaster that makes me love it so much..  I have always like the concept of Magic, but there is just an overwhelming amount of content and mechanics to deal with so it never clicked.  I feel like Radlands has the same general feel of Magic, but in a much more streamlined package. 

**Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition** – I have only been able to play about 3 games of this, but holy cow do I love it.  I love strategically trying to figure out how to make the best engine to get the resources to terraform Mars.  This is another competitive game that doesn't feel competitive, I just kind of chill and do my thing.

**Dice Throne, AKA BATTLE DICE.** - This is just a really cool concept that was executed really well.  The production value is insane, the games feel balanced, and it has an easy entry point for people who don't play a lot of board games.  Plus, it is just pure dumb fun to roll dice.  This one hits the table a lot because it's one of the few that bot Myself and my Partner enjoy a lot.

**Dice Throne Adventures** - I mean, it mixes Dice Throne with one of my favorite genres - Roguelite Dungeon Crawler.  There is a ton of content to explore, including 4 big boss fights, so it feels like you really get your money's worth.  I really love that you get to upgrade your deck between sessions, and I like that it gives you the option to make Dice Throne cooperative.

**Pandemic Legacy/Pandemic Games** - Pandemic was the first board game I played as an adult, around 2012.  My partner at the time an I played probably 50+ sessions and were just obsessed with it, so it's a gimme to have in the collection.  I picked up Call of Cthulu as well, which is similar in concept, but executed differently.  It's pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's more amazing than Pandemic.  What is amazing is Pandemic Legacy Season 1.  It took me a while to pull the trigger because of the cost of entry, but I am glad I picked it up.  I love the stress that comes from knowing that your session is going to permanently alter your experience going forward.  It feels wrong to rip up a card, but that's part of the thrill.

**Codenames** - This is just a fun game to play socially with people who don't really board game.  The concept is simple and point of entry is low.  It also usually ends in a lot of laughter because ""WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE POSSIBLY MEANT?!""

**Tiny Epic Galaxies** - Everyone I have tried to play this with hates it, which sucks because I think it is brilliant.  I like having to make difficult decisions on what to do with your rolls, and collecting planets is fun.  Not much more to say than that

**Gloomhaven JOTL** - Absolutely love this game.  It is increadibly in depth, has a massive amount of content, and forces you to be highly strategic.  I have only been able to play two sessions with a friend, but I'm really hoping to get it on the table more.  I love RPG's, so this game holds a lot of value to me.

**Trash Pandas** - I will be honest, I have no idea why I love this game.  It is not on anyone's list, no one talks about it, it's a overly simple concept of rolling dice to gain actions.  It's just chill to play in-between more complex games.  I just like it.

**BOTTOM FIVE:**

**Side Effects** -  Honestly I did not expect anything great from this, so I can't really be mad.  The concept is fun and the art is pretty good, and it just seemed kind of novel.  I'll likely never get this one on the table, so it will probably just take up space until I need it for something else.

**Flux** - A game that develops as you go is fun in theory, but in practice it just feels like work trying to keep everything straight. And that's just how I feel about the base game, some of the others are just unnecessarily complicated.

**Cuphead** - Love the art, love the production value, love Cuphead.  Hate the damn game itself though.  It feels like there's not enough time to actually get your actions, and you have barely any health so it's tough to get through one of the decks.  I'm keeping it as a collector's item, but it's unlikely that it will make it to the table again.

**Ticket to Ride** - My partner loves this, so it will stay in my collection, but I just find it kind of boring.  It's an easy game to teach people, so it's great for sessions with people who don't play a lot... but it's just not that fun to me.  

**Forbidden Island** - Look, it's ""*fine*"".  I got it because it looked cool on tabletop, and I like cooperative games.  What I found, however, is that this is basically ""My First Cooperative Game"".  It just feels like Pandemic watered down, nothing to really write home about.  It's easy enough to teach people, so I'll probably keep it for now... at least until I want something that can take the space.


I did not put Arkham Horror LCG anywhere, but I want to acknowledge it.  Everyone loves this game, I kind of get why.  My problem is that it has entirely too much going on, and I have no idea how to play after doing 6+ hours of going through the rulebooks and watching videos.  There are just too many questions that come up which aren't easy to answer quickly.  I would probably love this game if I had someone experienced to sit through it with me and help me understand how certain situations should play out.  I could also just be dumb and lazy, completely possible.",,109,,57,,public

boardgames,u/boardgamerecommeder needs a new home,False,77,0,"Hi all,

I'm the author of u/boardgamerecommender. It's the board game recommendation bot I've run here for, I don't know, 7 years? 8 years? It's given me personally so many great finds and I know it has for at least some of you. I wouldn't have found several of my now-favorite games without it, which was my original goal!

Sadly, I recently underwent a series of pretty serious medical conditions, and then I moved towns and personal situations, which as a result, has left me not running the bot for quite a while. Sorry about that. I'm going to get it re-connected within the next week. Thanks to the users who notified me about it and sorry I took a while to get onto it.

I've run stuff like /u/boardgamerecommender for a long time. [couchmoney](https://couchmoney.tv/), [coldwarsoundtrack](http://coldwarsoundtrack.com/), private forums for sufferers of oddly specific conditions, [couchmoneytrivia](https://couchmoneytrivia.tv), and contributions to open source, among others.

Unfortunately, I can't do that anymore and so would like a new home for u/boardgamerecommender. It has some very specific requirements:

1. able to run on a 24/7 server for the foreseeable future and commit to supporting this community better than I have
2. able to run Java with at least 16 GB of RAM dedicated to two processes with a significant amount of I/O, as well as a few hundred GB of storage
3. a person who has been a professional full-time Java developer for at least 5+ years and can demonstrate that to me
4. a person who has at least 5+ years profile history of being helpful and positive on Reddit, especially but not necessarily on r/boardgames or other gaming subs
5. a person who is happy to agree to a document to never personally financially benefit from recommending board games to people

If you think you match the above, which I think someone on this sub will, let's have a chat! If you think these requirements are too extreme, feel free to express yourself, but I'm confident I will find someone who matches the above and don't really want to debate my requirements.

It's possible that command-line bots like u/boardgamerecommender have run their course and people now only want mobile websites/apps instead; usage has significantly declined in the past couple years. Whether or not that's the case, I would still be willing to share everything this project has taught me with anyone who qualifies under #4 and #5 above.

My friends birthday is coming up in November. He loves board games. He showed me a video of one he is interested in but I can’t remember the name nor find the video. 

I don’t want to spoil the gift so I can’t ask him out right. If I describe the game can someone help me locate it? 

The game was a space in a spiral looking layout. The sun or black hole (can’t remember which) is expanding and will eat and consume all the planets. Each player is a nation that is moving operations and ships to other planets or moons and what not. Each nation is contributing to a mega ship ark that will take off and leave the solar system. 

Each player wants to leave influence of their country on the ark ship. So researching and accomplishing tasks is how you do so. As time goes on the sun or black hole sucks the tile spaces towards the center and eats those spaces until you run out. 

He said he was interested in it but couldn’t afford it. I think it was plastic heavy.

boardgames,Why Aren't More Board Gaming Companies taking advantage of Video Games?,False,0,0,"In the past few years, we've seen games like Spirit Island, Unmatched, and Ticket to Ride get video game adaptations. As far as I know, these have been huge successes, and board gamers tend to be video gamers too, so in my view there's a huge missed opportunity for gaming companies. 

I ask this because I don't get to go to a board gaming meetup and bring big games with me. It's not practical, people usually aren't in the mood to spend their entire game night on one game, and I don't get to go out as much. However, with online board gaming options like Twilight Wars, treachery.online, and Board Game Arena, I've been able to meet with friends more often to play, even if just on a virtual space. More video game adaptations of board games would be both profitable for the companies making them and beneficial for us, so why don't more companies do this?

Something else that just occurred to me is that the video game adaptations will usually cost less than the board games, so it would also be a great way to test a game before committing to it.",,44,,0,,public

Hi all, I designed the game Can't Touch This and am giving away 20 free copies to 20 random people who **leave a comment** on this post!

[Can't Touch This, winner of the multiplayer category in the 2023 In-Hand Design Contest on Board Game Geek](https://preview.redd.it/g5rwowhdbwr91.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97efe32834defbedfb1839382edb782d1766f205)

**Eligibility:**

* Your account must be at least 10 days old at the end of the giveaway.

* You must live somewhere that the USPS First-Class Mail International® (FCMI) service delivers to. This is most countries, but there are some rare exceptions.

This giveaway is entirely contained on Reddit. You don’t have to disclose any personal information to enter, but if you win, I will need your mailing address.

**What do I get for winning?**

A copy of my game, Can't Touch This. It is a 1-2 player set collection game played on 1 card and with 6 paperclips. Each card has a **computer generated layout**, and if you have some paperclips laying around, you can print and play it for free directly from [my website](https://www.jorgezhang.com/2021/12/cant-touch-this/index.html)! It makes for a great portable wallet game- it won first place in the multiplayer category in a design contest for games not necessitating table space.

I will use redditraffler.com to randomly select 20 comments from this post that fit the eligibility requirements. I will pm the winners directly, and also announce them in this post on Friday, October 7th, 2022, 10 PM CST!

**What should I comment?**

I am working on self-publishing my upcoming social deduction/logic matrix game, Orp - The Market for Space Merchant Translators (expected release in early 2023), and I would like to know which of the following 6 alien words is your favorite design! The main twist that differentiates Orp from other social deduction games is the fact that you know the translation to 1 of 6 alien words instead of receiving a secret role. Your goal is to decipher the meaning of each alien word and obtain the correct items for your wealthy client!

You can also just comment whatever you want- the above is just a suggestion.

It is definitely one I will be attending in the years to come.  Thank you so much for making this experience possible.

A few observations from the event include:

**Games That Were Always Being Played**

* Inis (seriously, seriously popular)
* Captain Sonar
* Wonderland's War
* Undaunted (multiple versions)
* Ra
* Brass Birmingham
* Terra Mystica / Gaia Project

**Memorable Events**

* When the whole hall applauded the winner of the all-day 8 player TI4 game

* Making eye contact with the person holding a blue balloon (looking for more players) and giving them the nod 

* Quinns, Tom, and Pip employing an actual lawyer from the crowd to recover the madly conceived ""Quinn's Courtroom"" panel

* Getting to chat during the ""sign stuff"" panel

**Con Positives**

* Lots of room to play games, you never had to wait for a table spot to open up

* 4x (4!) simultaneous games of Blood on the Clocktower running nearly all con

* Great lending library; had nearly everything you would have wanted in it

* Super smooth badge process and friendly volunteers

* Meeting lots of great new people when looping in additional players; nearly a 100% pleasant experience rate which is far better than you might usually get in a public board game group gathering.

* Con dynamics meant you could play games nearly back to back for the entire day if you wanted, great value for time

**Con Negatives (Con-Cons?)**

* Not enough Matt. We missed you Matt.

* Odd concession hours.  Tough in a ""no outside food"" venue to have it open late and close early.

**Games of the Show**

* Ready Set Bet (AEG) -- lots of loud shouting and general enjoyment; app is genuinely useful to the game

* Blood on the Clocktower (Pandemonium Institute) -- tougher to run in a loud environment, but I was impressed with how cleanly people could be onboarded and ready to play using only the base materials; was really thoughtful to split out ""new"" and ""advanced"" groups",,56,,210,twilight-imperium,public

boardgames,My experience at the first World Series of Board Gaming in Las Vegas,False,149,0,"I'm finally back from World Series of Board Gaming and it was quite a week. Overall I had a really great time and the use of the Dice Tower West games library for attendees to check out games was absolutely amazing... so many games available to play that it made my head spin!   


But I also think it's important to recognize a few things that could have been done better:   


1. Where games had low signups, some frustrating decisions were made on how to handle the tournament rounds. For example, I was in the Dominant Species Marine tournament, and there were apparently only 22 people signed up for it. This number does not allow for a simple, even set of tables, and so the organizers had to come up with a strategy on how to run the three rounds of the tournament. Unfortunately, they decided to focus on having a four-player table in the final as the main goal, and it meant that they seated only two tables of four (of which I was a player in) for the first round, and gave FOURTEEN byes to the other players, who sat around for three hours while eight of us competed for two spots in round 2. It was incredibly frustrating to feel that I had to compete for a seat in the ""real"" tournament in round 2, and I didn't win that game so I was out, while 14 people ""jumped the line"". A similar issue apparently happened with Gaia Project as well, though I think they only ended up with something like 7 byes in round 1.  


2. Time was seemingly haphazardly dealt with. On Saturday, the Terraforming Mars tournament started at 9am, and I was signed up for Dune Imperium at 3pm the same day. Apparently, one of the ROUND ONE tables of Terraforming Mars still had not finished by 3pm, and for some reason that meant that we couldn't get seated for our first round of Dune Imperium until almost 3:30. That would have been fine.... except that when it got to be 5:00, we were told ""you have 30 minutes left!"" because the second round was scheduled for 5:30, and despite our complaints that we lost a half hour at the beginning of our slot, we were still forced to speed through a few rounds at the end, potentially upsetting the strategy of those at the table (including my own). So then, why were the Terraforming Mars players allowed to play for HOURS past their scheduled time, but then our much shorter time was cut even shorter?   


3. A smaller complaint, but the awards ceremony on Sunday evening was pretty poorly attended because people needed to get to flights and it was held at 5pm. Not sure how to make this better though.  


Again, overall I really had a fantastic time, and I would for sure be interested in competing again in the future. Perhaps after a few years to work out some kinks and growing pains, though.",,83,,149,dune-imperium,public

boardgames,"[Self-Promotion] I've been working for 5 years on a Pokemon-inspired game that's played with Poker cards, and the first prototype arrived!",False,35,0,"[Here it is!](https://imgur.com/a/kIwEcq2)

The game is called Enmity Engine. It's a horror-themed fighting card game for 2 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes (but can be as quick as 10-15 minutes if you're used to playing). It works like this: Each player has a team composed of 3 Fighters and a deck of Poker cards. Both players have one Active Fighter out at any given time that face off against each other.

Each round, both players take 1 action, then choose a move by setting a card from their hand face-down. Once both players are done, they reveal their face-down cards and, depending on what move cards they chose, resolve their moves, which will either cause them to Attack or Switch their Active Fighter.

Over the course of the game, your Fighters generate a resource called Insight, which can be spent to Awaken them to upgrade their abilities or launch their Signature Moves (kinda like Mega Evolutions and Z-Moves, to borrow Pokemon's terms).

The game ends when one player's Fighters are defeated, after which the other player wins the game.

After playing simultaneous reveal fighting card games like Yomi, BattleCON, and Exceed for a while, I noticed that they were the closest we had to a tabletop version of competitive Pokemon, and that inspired me to start working on this game. Over the years I spent working on it, it's changed form drastically multiple times as I tried to figure out how moveset customization would work, starting from being a Sakura Arms-style dueling game where you construct your card pool after looking at your opponent's options, to being a handbuilder, to being a Smash-Up style shuffle-builder, to being a deckbuilder, until finally I decided to just axe customization to get what we have now.

And I'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out. For one, it made playtesting/balancing much less of a nightmare, but it also makes it a breeze to setup and play. Half the setup is basically just choosing 3 Fighters and shuffling up your Poker deck, which makes it easy to just play like 10 games in a row, since there's so little downtime.

If you're interested in the game, please check out the website I set up for it, where you can find a sample print &amp; play and rules PDF.

Does anyone know where I can buy (small) plastic stands like this? This one is from an old Talisman box. I have some small (4-5cm standees) that I want to use, but the bases I am seeing for sale on most websites look too big for them. d20 for scale. Any help appreciated!

boardgames,Should WotC reprint ALL of Magic: The Gathering?,False,0,0,"So, [WOTC is reprinting its Beta set of Magic from 30 years ago](https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/magic-the-gathering-s-999-30th-anniversary-edition-includes-reserved-list-reprints/ar-AA12AH47), but still locking it into booster packs and pricing it at $999:

Honestly, this really highlights better than anything else they've ever done how much Magic is like gambling. Non-legal, 30 years old, and there's STILL no guarantee you'll get a Lotus?

Wouldn't it be incredible for WOTC to just... reprint everything? Like, what if they said, ""Once a set is ten years old, you can pay a hefty price for one copy of every card in the set."" That'd be glorious. We could finally make (non-legal) decks from the whole history of the game without having to spend millions on the back market. It'd revolutionize the way the game is played in households and casually at schools, shops, etc.

Of course, removing the gambling aspect would certainly eat into the company's profits, but...

Would you support WOTC offering reprints, non-legal, of their older sets, or would you prefer they didn't out of caution against it tanking the company's profits and possibly ending Magic?",,30,,0,,public

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend group we play weekly different board games. We are older guys, and most of us come together to have fun. However one of the guys takes it a bit too seriously in my opinion. When it seems that he is losing in a game he starts to berate others and whine. He also tends to carry grudges between games, even from events that happened weeks ago.   


For example goes all in on someone in the first round in a strategy game, just to knock out someone who had ""wronged"" him in a previous game, even when his move does not make sense.

I have tried to talk with him, and explain to him that most people are playing board games for the community. But he can not see further than who is winning or losing.

boardgames,What I learned from 100 games of 7 Wonders (with Stats!),False,686,0,"TLDR:

Have you ever felt that a lot of strategic and tactical advice in board games is based on personal opinions that are not backed up by actual data? If the answer is yes, you are going to enjoy this read.

As a guy that loves stats, excel and board games, I dissect data from 100 games of 7Wonders (played over the course of the last 2 years) to back up arguments on some apparent contrarian opinions, which wonders seem to overperform and underperform, and the deeper implications on general strategy that this analysis suggests.

At the end of all this, 7Wonders remains a wonderful game that strikes a healthy mix between randomness and skill giving both first timers a fairly good shot at winning the game, and veteran players opportunities to stand out by carving out small edges at every turn.

But do not despair! There are still plenty of opportunities here to justify your loss at your gaming table because of some statistically underpowered wonder…

Link to all the data can be found here: [7Wonders Stats (100 games)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M0M3_MZKtMM6r0bk07wYEITEZOTK0vyDfiPb4wp_auE/edit?usp=sharing)

—--------------------------------------------------------

Back in 2019 I received 7 Wonders as a Christmas gift from my sister. She knew I was a big boardgame fan and that I have always been interested in ancient history, so she thought this game would be a perfect combination for me. As some here will probably relate, I am always a bit apprehensive when receiving boardgame presents from people that are not into the hobby, and I won’t lie, I was sceptical here too. Little did I know that a pandemic was about to come, and that this would become my most played game of the last two years..

As we started playing more often, I quickly acquired a few expansions, and once I integrated them into the core game, I started keeping track of our scores on an excel spreadsheet (see attached). Fast forward 2.5yrs, 31 friends and 100 games later, and this is the result.

All games recorded have been played with the same exact setup of core games + the following expansions:- 7 Wonders: Cities (includes Petra and Byzantium)- 7 Wonders: Cities Anniversary Pack (adds more Cities cards)- 7 Wonders: Wonder Pack (we used only The Great Wall and Stonehenge)

Why specifically only those? I like the base game the way it is, the only expansions I added were those that made it “more of the same”.

You can find a lot of guides online that share a lot of good strategies and ideas, but they all do it with only the core game in mind. As not everyone will be familiar of the characteristics with Cities, here is a heads up:

It stretches the core game by an extra turn – which means scores will be higher on average.- Cities cards work like Guild cards: there are a lot more of them in the pool than you play with in a single game, and you shuffle them inside the deck based on the number of players. This means that in a larger group, you will get to see a lot more Cities cards and have more opportunities to score points from them.- Cities cards do not have a single theme, but they have small thematic groups that align to all other card colors: better economy, coin losing cards, military boosts (both in points and shields), big point cards, extra Science cards.

The original idea behind collecting the stats was purely to answer one question: are all wonders built equally?

You can find plenty of analysis online of wonders that state “X is better than Y”, but they are all opinions for the most part, and they all analyze wonders in a vacuum based on their experience. What I can promise you here is that all of my arguments will be based on data. You might disagree with my findings, but we will all be discussing things from the same baseline.

**READERS BEWARE**: I’m well aware that 100 games are not really what a statistician would call a “statistically significant” number, nor does it follow rigorous statistical analysis. It is also going to be idiosyncratic to the way our group plays, and might not be representative of all tables. This is really just for the fun of seeing patterns in the data, speculate, and, most importantly, give you that much needed ammunition to complain at your table that you didn’t win because of some overpowered wonder…

Before we jump into the wonders analysis, I thought it might be interesting to look at some interesting insights from the data I collected. Here is my list.

# TOP 5 OBVIOUS FINDINGS:

1. **Yes, massive Science combos do win you games** – your win rate increases by a whopping 10.6% points above average when you score 25 or more Science points.
2. **But avoiding Science is fine too** – avoiding Science altogether does not have a significant impact on your win chances.
3. **And yes, Military blow outs also win you games** – similarly to Science, your win rate increases by 9.3% points when scoring 11 or more Military points.
4. **You are (sort of) right at choosing that B side** **(for the original wonders)**:
   1. A side (original 7 wonders): 20.8% winrate
   2. B side (original 7 wonders): 26.4% winrate
   3. That said, most A sides perform just fine and within average, with a couple of exceptions (Babylon and Rhodos)
5. **You can be (statistically) significantly better at this game than your friends** – as my friend proves, by not only winning well above expected, but also scoring on average much higher than any other player. Funny enough, when I asked them how they do it, they simply stated that they always focus on maximizing their own score, not preventing others from accessing good cards. It is not quite what you read on online articles, but it seems to be really effective at our table.

# TOP 5 SUPRISING FINDINGS:

1. **4 player games have the lowest points averages** – this might be due to the abundance of resource cards at 4 players (as highlighted by Red Proper[ here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/691370/some-complex-strategies-7-wonders)), or other card distributions. Just don’t be surprised when you play with 4 players and you have a low score and get away with a win.
2. **Economic cards are bad for you** – no matter which way you cut it, Economic points have a fairly apparent negative correlation to win rate (basically scoring any Economic points always lowers your win chances). On top of that, many wonders performance seem inversely correlated to how many Economic points/game they average. This is probably due to a combination of factors, including the fact that economic cards score poorly in the Third Age in particular. Also, anecdotally, our best player almost always stays away from them.
3. **Byzantium doesn’t suck** – in fact it holds a very respectable win rate with both side A and B. And, even though it is so far a small sample, it doesn’t seem to perform much worse at higher player counts (where you would intuitively assume its power becomes less effective).
4. **Stonehenge doesn’t suck either** – regardless of its apparent nonsensical Wonder stages point structure, Stonehenge does not seem to suffer particularly bad average points nor win rates. Solutions to fix this wonder seem unwarranted.
5. **Players really build affinity for certain wonders** – our best player won EVERY single time they played The Great Wall B, and 8 out of 9 times with The Great Wall overall. I got 50% winrate with both Giza and Halikarnassus, much higher than any other player. There are cases with other players as well.

Okay, back to the wonders. So, how do you determine if a wonder is good or not? After much deliberating, I settled for 2 key metrics:

|**Win Rate Performance**                                     (Win Rate above/below Expected Win Rate)|This metric subtracts the blend of your expected win rate (33% in a 3-player game, 25% in a 4-player game etc.) from your actual win rate. Positive means you win more often than you should, negative you win less often than you should.                                                             We will refer to this stat as “Win Rate Performance” for simplicity from now on.|
|:-|:-|
|**Points Performance**                                       (Average Points of the Player/Wonder above/below Average Points in a Game)|For each game I calculated the average (ex. hypothetical 3-player game of 60, 50 and 40  points would mean an average of 50) and calculated the delta from average in the game (so for the same game: +10, 0, -10). A positive average delta means that you consistently score above average, while a negative one means you consistently score below. This stat should be able to catch Wonders that perform well overall, but might have missed out on a few wins by small margins.                                                       We will refer to this stat as “**Points Performance**” for simplicity from now on.|

# THE OVERPOWERED WONDERS:

**The Great Wall B**

|Win Rate Performance|\+22.6%|Win Rate|Expected Win Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Points Performance|\+2.95 pts|45.5%|22.8%|

\# Games: 22

||Avg  Pts|Military|Coins/ Debt|Wonder|Civilian|Economic|Science|Guilds|Cities|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Average|**64.0**|3.1|4.1|0.0|10.8|1.9|35.9|5.8|2.4|
|When Win|**70.4**|1.5|3.9|0.0|7.8|0.8|46.4|7.0|3.0|
|When Loss|**58.7**|4.4|4.3|0.0|13.3|2.8|27.2|4.8|1.9|

Are you looking for a wonder to exclude from your games? Look no further than The Great Wall, with an almost 50-50 chance of winning the game when playing with the B side (although not on the same level, A side performs rather well too).

The Great Wall B side is the true standout performer among all wonders, topping every metric: highest win rate, highest average points per game, highest Win Rate Performance, highest Points Performance.

What makes The Great Wall B side so strong?

**Science, Science and more Science:** The obvious piece is that GW scores a whopping 35.9 points/game on science, the most of any wonder. The only other one that comes even close being the A side of GW. There are a trio of synergistic elements that make this happen:

\- Cloth starting resource on the board makes it easy to grab science early on.

\- Two wonder powers are linked to paper, another manufactured good. This further encourages grabbing paper early on, which makes you primed for an early science start.

\- In case you don’t get access to manufactured goods in the early rounds, stage 4 is the perfect counter – giving you any type of resource you don’t have to capture those precious science cards.

**Missing out on Military**: GW B is one of the lowest scorers on the board for military, but even more interesting is the fact that winners with GW B only score 1.5 points in Military (losers with GW B score 4.4 points on average in Military). It seems that players that lean on the wonder’s peace power are rewarded, but it also exemplifies another emergent theme: when you go heavy on science, you sacrifice the right opportunities to play military cards.

**Accumulate those coins:** Another, very surprising, point of note is that GW B has the highest points from coins than any other wonder (the only one averaging above 4 points/game), DESPITE scoring very low with economic cards. This is even more apparent when looking specifically only at GW B winners, who only score 0.8 points from economic cards on average. The Stage 1 power giving you 8 coins must have something to do with it, but GW A has a similar wonder stage and only manages 1.3 points/game from coins. This leads us back to the point about manufactured goods – you need few resources to get your engine going and can compensate for the missing ones with your Stage 4. This helps heavily reduce the number of coins you have to pay to your neighbours - which in turn potentially stifles their own chances of purchasing much-needed resources.

**Avoid Economic cards:** The low point score from Economic cards goes contrary to something I surely thought was the case: that 4 stage wonders (Giza and The Great Wall) are heavily favoured because of the Arena. GW B players, and winners in particular, very rarely benefit from building an arena as a way to capitalize on all 4 stages.

Looking at the average stats of all losers with GW B, we can also learn **how to defeat it**: block them out of Science cards, pushing them to lean into Military and Civilian structures.

One interesting point to note that is GW B is statistically significantly better than its A side cousin, contrary to much online tribal wisdom. This is exactly what I was hoping to achieve with this analysis, actually debating wonders using data instead of simply strategic opinions. I think this comes down to ease of build for wonder stages. Side A stages lack resource synergies and are quite expensive, while on side B you have 2 very clear routes to go: paper+wood, or stone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Halikarnassus B**

|Win Rate Performance|\+12.2%|Win Rate|Expected Win Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Points Performance|\+1.81 pts|34.8%|22.6%|

\# Games: 23

||Avg  Pts|Military|Coins/ Debt|Wonder|Civilian|Economic|Science|Guilds|Cities|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Average|**62.7**|5.3|2.1|3.0|9.7|2.3|27.3|8.2|4.8|
|When Win|**69.9**|3.0|1.3|2.9|11.4|1.4|35.4|10.8|3.9|
|When Loss|**58.9**|6.6|2.6|3.0|8.7|2.9|22.9|6.9|5.3|

Halikarnassus B comes third both in Winrate Performance and Points Performance, suggesting it is a very consistent performer.

**Science (again)**: Hal B shares many characteristics with The Great Wall B: a very high Science scorer, while being a low Civilian, Economic and Military scorer. Hal B scores high on Science thanks to the following:

\- It starts with a manufactured good, giving it an early boost to Science.

\- Its power allows it to recover some science cards that might be discarded away, recovering on missed out opportunities, or potentially recovering a missing resources and manufactured goods necessary to build missing Science card trees.

**Forget about Civilian points:** Hal B is the lowest scorer of Civilian  points out of all wonders. This is something it has in common with GW B as well. But data suggests that Civilian cards strategies are not underpowered. I wonder if this is more of a lagging indicator: it might have to do with the fact that Civilian cards are always good points options when nothing else is available, and they very rarely end up in the discard pile, reducing chances for Hal B players to score points from them.

**Opportunistic Military:** However, interestingly enough, winners with Hal B score 3 points less on average in Military while scoring 3 points more on average with Civilian cards compared to those that lose with the wonder. It might mean that winners commit less cards to Military, managing to score just enough points from a discarded card, giving them more opportunities to secure points from elsewhere.

**Snatch those Guild cards:** Hal B winners score &gt;10 points/game with Guild cards and Hal B side scores 2 more points from Guild Cards than its side A cousin on average. Jury is still out as to whether we can make any statistically significant guesses from Guild cards without looking at the specifics of each game, but my educated guess would be that Hal B power makes it easy to grab extra resources, which means Hal B is rarely locked out of Guild cards and can capitalize on those opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

**Petra A**

|Win Rate Performance|\+5.3%|Win Rate|Expected Win Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Points Performance|\+2.23 pts|27.8%|22.5%|

\# Games: 18

||Avg  Pts|Military|Coins/ Debt|Wonder|Civilian|Economic|Science|Guilds|Cities|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Average|**62.2**|5.1|2.9|16.2|14.7|3.2|7.2|8.4|4.5|
|When Win|**69.9**|10.4|2.6|17.0|16.8|2.4|5.0|6.8|7.8|
|When Loss|**58.9**|3.1|3.1|15.9|13.8|3.5|8.0|9.1|3.2|

Petra A’s winrate might make it an odd choice for most powerful wonder, but it has a surprisingly outstanding Points Performance: the only wonder other than The Great Wall B to average &gt;+2 points.

Do you remember all you learned about Halikarnassus and The Great Wall? Forget military, forget Civilian and go heavy Science? Well Petra A goes against ALL of that. This is what makes this game so interesting!

**High Wonder Stage Points**: Petra A’s biggest strength is (of course) its Wonder stages points. Not only Petra A scores the 2nd highest Wonder  points per game (16.2), but what makes it truly standout (and differentiate from its B side), is by how easily it can maximize its Wonder  points. Petra A players scored all 17 of their Wonder points in 17 out of 18 occasions. The Wonder  points give you a strong points base to build from with only 3 cards. No Petra A player ever scored less than 53 points in a game, the highest floor of any wonder.

**Flexible**: Looking at the overall average, it can be difficult to discern much else about Petra A. being middle of the road in most categories. However, this also suggests that it is a very flexible wonder that can be played many different ways.

**Red and Blue:** We can see some trends here. Winners with Petra A score a whopping 10.4 Military points/game on average. Petra A is perfect for this strategy: 2 of its Wonder stages requiring Stone and Wood, while providing you Clay as a starting resource. The perfect invitation to lean a Civilian + Military strategy, topped up with some nice 17 Wonder points.

**Combo with Cities Cards:** This strategy can be often complemented by some good Cities cards. Although random in nature, you are likely to find some that either boost Military (extra shields, extra points per Military Victory or even extra Military Victories altogether) or plain points (there are 2 separate heavy points structure trees). Petra A winners capitalize on this, scoring on average 4 more points from Cities cards than their losing counterparts. The cherry on top of the Wonder+Blue+Red strategy is Black.

# THE UNDERPOWERED WONDERS:

|When Loss|**56.9**|10.3|2.3|9.1|12.7|3.3|4.0|8.1|7.2|

It is now time for the less fun part, the losing side of the coin. There were certainly some surprises, like Rhodos A, which boasts the worst winrate of any wonder, and is a strong runner for worst wonder overall.

I had to think really hard on this one, because there are many conflicting statistics. Does the fact that Rhodos A scores poorly (and Rhodos B not faring much better), while The Great Wall/Halikarnassos scoring highly without Military, mean that Military strategies suck? Statistics seem to indicate otherwise – across all wonders the average winner scores &gt;3 points/game more from Military than the average loser.

Maybe it has to do with the fact that Rhodos requires 4 ore resources to build a wonder stage, which is hard to get and easy to block? I thought this was a good lead, but I found out that the average player gets full wonder stage points 88% of the time, which is well within average across the board, and better than many wonders.

So, what’s wrong with Rhodos A?

**Feeling Blue**: it is a well-documented strategy that Military and Civilian go well together because they require much of the same resources. Yet, Rhodos A seems to struggle to capitalize on this synergy, scoring a very average 13.2 points/game from Civilian cards (Rhodos B on the other hand does the job really well with 19.2 points/game from Civilian, leading to much better win rates and average points/game).

**Wonder stages resource requirements**: yes I know I just said that 4 ores wasn’t a leading cause of weakness, but I think it is worth looking deeper at Rhodos A from a resource/reward perspective. As wiser people online have pointed out, the 2 shields bonus that Rhodos A gives you is only good if you also build Military cards to capitalize on it. But Rhodos’ stages have fairly high resource requirements: you need to get 2 woods, 3 clay and 4(3) ores. Clay is not a particularly useful resource for Civilian cards in the high amounts the wonder needs, and only 2 Military cards require more than 1 ore, and one of them needs stone. Furthermore, you will be excluded from some Military buildings without a hefty amount of stone, and you need at least access to all manufactured goods to capitalize on a palace, guilds and other powerful cards in the Third Age. That is a lot of resources you need access to for a Blue/Red strategy. It is true that wonders like Giza also require hefty resources, but they reward you with immediate points (can 2 shields give you &gt;5 points/game consistently?).

&amp;#x200B;

You might be tempted to think that all the worst wonders would have in common a low scientific score, but Babylon A is here to prove otherwise. Babylon A is another case of a Wonder side that typically online is considered stronger than its B side counterpart, but that stats prove otherwise.

**Coins and Resources struggles**: one of the most atypical aspects of this wonder is that it is designed with Science in mind, but starts without a manufactured good. Starting with Clay means that you need more turns to get your Science engine firing and, unless extremely lucky, you end up paying at least once for a manufactured good from a neighbour to get a precious Science card in the First Age. This often creates a vicious cycle of starting the Second Age low in coins, forcing you into Economic cards to boost your income first, and potentially missing out on some of the best cards in the first hand of the Second Age without the necessary coins to access your neighbours’ resources. This is why Babylon A’s average Science score/game (22.2) is high, but much lower than Science powerhouses The Great Wall B (35.9) and Halikarnassos B (27.3), and why it is not enough to compensate for missing out on points in other areas. This is further validated by Babylon A’s lowest score from Coins in the game (1.3 points/game on average) – it seems that to go for the Science strategy you need to spend a lot of coins.

**Science over Military**: do you remember our discussion for Halikarnassos? Same applies here – trying to go heavy Science sacrifices Military structures. Babylon is the 2nd lowest scorer for average Military points/game (0.5), after Byzantium A, which is a wonder that pushes you into avoiding conflict altogether!

**Those damn Guilds**: Babylon A has another really low score area, which it shares with Petra B – very low average Guild card scores. A high guild score does not necessarily make you a winner, but it seems that those resource and economic struggles at the beginning limit your ability to get your hands on key guild cards in the Third Age.

&amp;#x200B;

**Petra B**

|When Loss|**54.4**|4.4|2.5|15.1|17.3|4.6|1.9|3.7|4.9|

Petra B is the a really tough wonder to play with. No other wonder has a bigger difference between their A side and their B side than Petra. But why does Petra B suck so much when Petra A doesn’t?

**14 Coins!**: Accumulating 14 coins to score 14 points is a much more daunting task than 7 coins for 7 points of it’s A side. While accumulating 7 coins might be something a resource heavy strategy would naturally lean into (by virtue of your neighbours buying resources from you), getting to 14 coins requires you to plan for it. A plan that needs to counteract Cities cards, many of which cause players to lose coins, further hurting Petra B.

**Economic cards**: so what does the Petra player do to catch up on coins? Play a lot of economic cards, the only one with a fairly negative correlation to win rate. By playing economic cards, especially in the second and third age as they are trying to catch up on the coins they need to build their last wonder stage, Petra B loses on many opportunities to make big strategic commitments (like Science). This is why Petra B players have the lowest average Science score overall (1.7 points/game), and the highest average Economic score (5.2 points/game).

**Guild cards**: The third piece I had not quite noticed before is that Petra B players also significantly miss out on Guild  points. Petra B has the lowest  points/game from Guild cards (3.6), with only 40% of Petra B players scoring any Guild points, compared to \~70% of players in the average game across all wonders. And while Guild cards are not necessary to win, Petra B often arrives in the Third Age with too many things yet to do (accumulate coins, build wonder, not missing out on high points Civilian cards), hurting its chances at snatching good Guild cards.

# FINAL THOUGHTS:

After spending hours looking at the game statistics, it’s disappointing to know that, even with all this knowledge and time spent analyzing this game, I am not even the best player at my table.

All that effort was not in vain however, as I was able dissect the different wonders with as little bias as possible. Often online guides rely on a simple explanation of the wonder stages in a vacuum, which appear reasonable but often do not hold up to statistical scrutiny: Stonehenge might appear nonsensical, yet it scores perfectly fine and has a good win rate. The Great Wall A might appear a better side, yet the B side is so much better statistically. And the A side of the original 7 wonders is somewhat weaker only in the Babylon and Rhodos cases, while the others hold up just fine with their B side counterparts.

As I spent more and more time looking at the data, I was surprised that I started paying more attention to the resource costs of wonder stages instead of their powers. Certain wonders just seem primed to synergize well with resources, while others don’t. Nothing shows this contrast more than The Great Wall and Petra, both with similar powers on each side, yet with a blatantly more useful side than the other. You might see me again in the future dropping another article on some additional 7 wonders theorycrafting - especially if I can convince my friends to play another hundred or more games!

Like many eternally good board and card games, 7 Wonders has a fine balance of randomness and depth, where a player on their first couple of games is able to take home a win with a bit of luck, but also where a good player can consistently outperform their opponents. Finding that balance is hard, but when you do, you have a game that can be fun for friends and relatives that only play once a year, as well as entertain those, like me,  that want to dive really deep into the game.

I have shared the link to my data in the hope that actual statisticians will be able to play with it and reveal other interesting trends. All I ask of in return is to post the interesting findings you will find. I have left tables from my analysis in the sheet, some more useful than others, for those that are interested and want to deep dive into the data.

There are always new shiny games ready to steal away your time and attention, and it is unlikely that I will again have the chance to dedicate so much time to a single board game. However, 7 Wonders will remain an eternally enjoyable game that will continue to hit my table every time we have too many players for anything else, or when someone is secretly looking to improve their statistics…",,120,,686,,public

You can find it  [here](https://ncdn1.daysofwonder.com/five-tribes/en/img/ft_solo_en.pdf). In addition to these rules here's what I've come up with adding the 2nd expansion:

A 6x6 tile board, so rolling the black die on 6 no longer makes Yazid to clear two tiles.

New lose conditions: If Yazid controls more fabulous cities at the game's end, you lose. (A tie results in defeat) If Yazid's dice roll lands on an empty tile, Yazid claims an unoccupied fabulous city in that column if available (No camel and has meeples on it). If the whole column is empty of meeples, Yazid claims an unoccupied fabulous city anywhere on the board  (must have no camel and has meeples on it).  You may want to pay to outbid him if this happens!

Yazid can take whim cards if he lands on a fabulous city and can fulfill them like the player can. If he does fulfill a whim, you must pay him from your own stash (similar to the blue builder rule). Since There are all kind of whim conditions, Yazid now does the tile action for placing palaces and palm trees. He also keeps merchandise instead of discarding them. If Yazid gains a whim to assassinate a colored meeple, the next assassin he picks up must be used to assassinate that meeple if possible, in accordance to the regular assassin rules. He cannot kill his own meeples. Both assassin(s) and killed meeple are put in the pouch.

boardgames,"Magic words required: I want to sell a game my wife absolutely hates, but she wants to keep.",False,55,0,"The game in question is SCYTHE. We mostly play cooperative games because she is extremely conflict sensitive, but agreed to give this a shot because of the art and my hype about it. This was last Christmas, where we got the game as a gift from my mom.

Our experience, despite houserules of not attacking / stealing from each other (which arguably gutted the game as tension, even without action, is a huge part of it), is abysmal. Every single time we played across this almost 1 year, she lost. She doesn't even want to know her score for some time now, which makes me not want to care about... Any of it, all of it! What's the point of a conpetitive game where you compare points if the other player doesn't want her points counted and compared? Then it was annoyance that the game ends when I reach 6 stars, and that her plans are left unfinished. Sure, do that, we keep playing. We finish it when she had 6 stars too, in the meantime I suffered through stacking money, won, and it was just as bad all the same.

We tried to play it with extended family as group of 5. She is somewhere in the middle by the end, but doesn't want her points counted. I win with 3 stars and 90 points, extended family while had fun, score 70-20. They like tge game, they don't mind losing because they are like me, they enjoy losing as long as they learn, improve, and feel smarter after every game. She cannot be like that when she is facing other players.

She hates all of it from her guts, and because of that, I developed a very strong distain, even disgust of the thought of putting on the desk.

Before I get relationship advices, her happiness is the most important to me, and I avoid suggesting SCYTHE. But she does put it on the table, I know she does it from a sense of guilt, the she made me hate it, something I was very happy about the ""honeymoon phase"", something my mom gifted us/me. 

I explained to her in detail, that boardgames are an activity we share, playing by definition is having fun doing something we enjoy and getting better at it or being comfortable where we are. Our experience differs with this game so much, that even if I used to like it, I hate to see her being miserable and I would prefer to play anything else instead, including our many coop games (she is a freaking master of Spirit Island! ♥️). It's okay to feel the way she feels about the experience she had, and I don't blame her or hold her responsible or resent her. We tried, on her request more than mine, to make it work and it does not work for us, and that's okay. That's why I want to sell it, because it just catches dust otherwise, and we could invest that money into games / expansions she likes, that we like. 

Nope, don't sell it! She made an incredibly pretty, printed on think paper, colored insert. A huge setvof boxes found on bgg files, and spent 5 hours cutting and gluing them. So we played again. And she is miserable, again. My distain towards the game is through the roof. Her sense of guilt, no matter what I say, is through the roof. Regarding extended family, they like SCYTHE, but not enough to not play something we are having more fun with (Terraforming Mars, Bang dice, Meadow, Last Bastion, Pandemic Rome, the list goes on), and honestly I don't care about if they'll miss it or not, I care about my wife's feelings first. 

How the hell do I get her to understand the issue here is not her, and that we should reforge (by selling) the game into something we like? Her dedication to me is lovely, but in this particular case, very unhealthy I think, and I cannot say this at the same time with ""it's not your fault"", because she keeps mixing these things as if saying this is paradoxical.",,112,,55,,public

boardgames,How to win Royal Visit?! (iello),False,6,0,"Hi,

This is quite a specific question about this board game. I’m playing Royal Visit by iello and I just can’t figure out what one rule is supposed to mean:

“If the deck runs out when the Crown token already has the Little Crown side up, the player with the King in their Duchy wins the game.”

1) Say towards the end of the game both players hold 8 cards and 2 are still in the pile/deck. Player A plays 3 cards. Is the game over? 

2) If not: What if player A plays 2 cards? Can we play until one player has less then 8 on their hands? And could I still use the wizard in that condition (no cards on the table, both players hold 8?)

3) Or do we keep playing until we’re done with our hand anyway?

I guess 1) is correct?

boardgames,Review of King’s Dilemma,False,5,0,"Let me preface this review by saying we just finished our 16th and final round of KD and I was the overall winner of the legacy game.

Going into this game, my expectations were that I was sitting on the small council like in Game of Thrones and I would have a lot of meaningful choices to affect the game. This unfortunately was nowhere near the result. As with any legacy game, I don’t like to look into the game TOO much incase I catch a spoiler so I probably could have watched some spoiler free videos to prepare myself first.

The good: I like having my own faction which I keep throughout the whole legacy. I think this is key to a good legacy. I also very much enjoyed the ending (which I won’t mention obviously). The artwork on the cards was also cool. The map that comes with the game is also cool.

The bad: the physical board is dull and a bit of a turnoff. You spend ~$100 on a game that has no miniatures and finite uses, I expect there to be a big map with pieces or a really cool board. This board looks like it was straight out of a prototype. While this may be a “good” for some people… but for me, this next point is a bad. The player who was doing the absolute worst in the game ended up with 2nd place based on how our game went in the endgame. There didn’t seem to be much of a payoff for me who entered the endgame as the clear leader compared to the player who entered having only won a single game. Seems a bit off to me.

The ugly: the rule book is BAD. I would say my group is pretty intermediate to heavy gamers and the rule book is horrific. They may as well not include it and make you guess the rules in some areas of the game. 

Overall: this game as a legacy game is about a 5/10 for me. In comparison, I would say Pandemic season 1 is a 10, Risk Legacy is a 1, and Scythe Legacy is about a 7-8.

Buy this legacy game with low expectations and you may get something out of it.",,15,,5,,public

boardgames,I need a Bananagrams killer to save my sanity this Christmas.,False,118,0,"My mom's favorite game is Bananagrams. If she's visiting, she's bringing Bananagrams and she'll dump it out on the floor and start flipping tiles over before you can really react. 

This is the only game she wants to play, and she wants to play it over and over during every visit. 

Now, I like Bananagrams. But it has become too much. I need another word game to put in the mix. Growing up, she played Scrabble with us but not much else. She likes games that are rules lite and fairly quick - I've tried introducing a lot of other games along those lines (original Tsuro, Qwirkle, etc) but I have a feeling that the only game that can dethrone THE BANANA is another word game. 

I bought and played Letter Tycoon recently (and enjoy it) but I can't find another copy for sale online (I got the only copy at my flgs and it seems out of stock on the manufacturer's website) and while I'm planning on taking it home at Christmas, I *really* wanted to get one to leave there. 

THINGS I THINK SHE LIKES ABOUT BANANAGRAMS

Easy setup

Receiving letters and spelling words as a mechanic

Quick gameplay

Short game duration 

Simple rules

Rewards having a good vocabulary

Portable

There are no new fear, minor or major power cards in the game.

boardgames,Rule Questions about Everdell,False,4,0,"Ok, so I love this game but honestly the rulebook is not the best, because it leaves some questions unanswered or gives vague instructions. Maybe it was improved in later editions, idk. My question is actually a pretty basic one. It concerns how many cards you can have in your city. The way it was explained to me and the way I've played it ever since is that if you move a critter into a construction they share a space. So if you let the teacher move into the school they take up one space and you have a maximum of 15 spaces. (If you played the teacher first and then play the school, he can still move in but you have to pay for both, as far as I understand the rules). But whateverr order you play them in, they share a space. A few days ago, we played the game and had to look up something about a specific situation that can occur (and is not covered in the rulebook) about the crane and the architect which put the way we play it into question, so my 2 questions are:

1. Do a construction and the matching critter, if the critter was moved into the construction, share a space in your city or do they take up 2 spaces?
2. If you remove a construction, do you also remove the critter ""living"" in it? (I don't think so, but at this point I'm just confused)

The questions might sound stupid but I just always played it the way it was explained to me and never had a reason to question that. 

Oh and I know that if you move a critter out, you still leave the occupied token and cannot move another critter in.

Edit: Thanks for all the help. I really appreciate it and can go on enjoying Everdell even more!",,11,,4,,public

boardgames,What should I do with this concept,False,0,0,"Not sure if this is the right place for this but many years ago there were two bored Highschoolers in a rural New England town with nothing to do. We were both big into fantasy of all stripes and had lots of friends into it too so we decided to start a LARP. Unfortunately there were not enough nerds to sustain it and making equipment was expensive so it failed but I put a ton of narritive work into it and have wanted to do something with it ever since.

Basically the plot was High Fantasy filled with all the Tolkien stolen races we could so plenty of Orcs, Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, and Halflings as well as an OC race of blue skinned barbarians called Outlanders from the snowy wastes to the north. The lore was effectively all the races except the Outlanders lived in tribal/city state style communities in the southern lands until a hero frustrated by the incessant warring united the lands excluding the Outlanders under a single Imperial Banner. He brought peace and prosperity by delegating the tasks of the nation to six guilds. Warriors Guild to protect the Kingdom and be the Military, Wizards Guild who were the scholars of the Empire, Black Guild who were spies and assassins of the Empire, Rangers Guild who were bounty hunters capturing or killing criminals and monsters alike, Clerics Guild a religious order that honored beings known as Celestials and who valued order, fairness, and peace that were in charge of things like the courts and treasury while running their temples, and finally the Druids another religious order that honored nature and its chaotic and wild attributes, they worshipped Valkrie and helped prevent famine, plague, and natural disaster.

Eventually though all good things come to an end and the king died just after finding out his only heir had been killed in a battle with Outlanders. This plunged the Empire into chaos as lords fought over the throne leaving openings for Outlanders to invade, powerful warlords and wizards to take power, monsters to run rampant including a brief demon invasion and even walking plagues like Vampirism, Lycanthropy, and Zombism to run rampant. During this time the Guilds realized the Empire would likely disolve before a new Emperor emerged to lead them if they didn't act so they reformed and became pretty autonomous and began a major push in their perspective roles and with the aid of a number of powerful leaders were able to contain the major threats. 

This created a balance of power where there were effectively six autonomous kingdoms with the Guilds having varrying levels of influence in each. Basically everyone agrees the empire should be restored but all of the six kings want to sit on the throne. Furthermore the Guilds have gotten a taste of autonomy and now want to shape the new Empire into their own image making whoever sits on the throne less an all powerful Emperor and more a puppet to their Guild. Roughly the Warriors want a military state, Wizards want a magical Geniocracy where the smartest and most magically capable lead, the Black Guild rebranded as the Assassins or Thieves Guild want a mafia style state, Rangers more or less want a police state, and both the Clerics and Druids want a Theocracy with their religion installed.

In our original concept we designed it this way to create lots of room for conflict and betrayal that all groups would have concern in as nearly all players would have a kingdom and a guild and thus competing loyalties would mean when one kingdom fought another Guilds would have to worry about their own members from each kingdom fighting one another and the vice versa of when Guilds Feuded each Kingdom would have to worry about violence breaking out on their streets as (for example) their Wizard subjects and Ranger Subjects started killing one another. Even better when a Guild and Kingdom had a conflict they'd both have to fear who among their shared players would take what side.

The constant threat of rogue wizards and war lords, vampire nests and werewolf dens popping up, demobs trying to break back in and Outlanders at the gates would keep the pressure on preventing any faction from being idle too long and providing players a constant supply of quests to keep busy with. I thought this would be a cool system that would create dramatic moments as well as ensure new low level players were protected as griefing a low level player would ensure the wrath of both the players kingdom and guild. I've considered turning it into a board game or RPG but don't know if it could fit well into either of those mediums without really cutting some large parts away from what it is.

I played with 4 others and I’d love a new story focused game to play with them. A lot of the similar games in BGG seem to be max 4 players. Even better if it’s a campaign. 

I have Mansions of Madness, Journeys of Middle Earth and Forgotten Waters. I enjoy all of these but I really like the more political negotiating aspect to The King’s Dilemma.

##FAQ

**I live in Barbados/Canada/Guatemala/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now I cnat spel amymor!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on hope and dreams, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

##Changes since last week

* Added tag for Gamefound's Stable Pledge program (🔄).

##Edit

Ugh, mental note: Editing a post removes all non-breaking spaces and screws up formatting.

boardgames,Painted models from the Waddingtons 1996 version of Cludeo,False,12,0,"Recently I managed to find an old copy of Waddingtons Cludeo.

This particular version of the game really means a lot to me as I have very fond memories of playing this with my brother and cousins when we were younger. One thing that amazed me when I found it was that is was made in my hometown.

Naturally when I got this nostalgic gem, I just had to paint the minis.  
Personally I always felt this version of the game had the best models, though my partner believes the one she grew up with is better... naturally.

Do other people have a particular version of Cludeo they prefer, or any other game.  
Personally I feel a lot of the modern versions of these iconic games lack their old charm.

boardgames,So I guess I own a badly worn copy of a shitty edition of my least favorite board game now,False,858,0,"So I'm at a church tag sale, always the best tag sales because no one has any idea what anything is worth so they underprice everything.

They have the usual assortment of horrible mass market kids games, but I decided to look at an old copy of *Castle Risk,* because while I fucking hate *Risk* and the box of this particular copy was pretty damaged, some editions come with little castles and tanks and knights on horseback as pieces and you can keep the pieces for other, better games. *Axis and Allies* and *Monopoly City* are amazing for their repurposable minis and tokens.

And I open it up carefully, because even if it sucks it's still a board game so board game careful mode automatically flips on in my brain, and I notice that nope these pieces are fucking trash, the troop markers are random little plastic X's that literally look like sprue waste left over from making something better out of plastic. Even the castles, which one would imagine are the raison d'etre for a game called ""Castle Risk,"" are tiny and ugly.

Well, as I'm closing the box in disgust, this incredibly sweet little old lady comes over delighted that I'm looking at the game,  and explains how it was her grandson's favorite game as a boy, and she'd be so glad if it found a new home with someone who would treasure it, and no one else had noticed it even though the tag sale was nearly over now, etc. etc.

So now I own a badly worn copy of a shitty edition of my least favorite board game. At least it was only 50 cents. Don't buy *Castle Risk*.

boardgames,Thoughts in splitwave shipping?,False,0,0,"Hey community, with ISS Vanguard delivering the core box for those that opted for the more expensive splitwave shipping and not having an ETA on the stretch goals. It got me thinking about the concept of the shipping games in waves. 

I'll use ISS Vanguard (IV) as my example. 

So, the campaign ran in the beginning of 2021 if I recall correctly with the promise of shipping the game in the fall of the same year. Due to delays the core box shipped now. 

What do you think about this practice? If an estimated time of arrival excludes stretch goals can it truly be regarded to meet its promise? A campaign game like IV has lots of content with stretch goals increasing the playtime even more, are we happier getting parts of the game early, being able to finish it before more content arrives extending its shelflife? 

Do we even care? I'm curious of what the community thinks about this side of crowdfunding.

boardgames,What are your favorite action selection mechanisms?,False,15,0,"The hallmark of a lot of good euros is their action selection mechanism. 

Some of my favorites are: 

- Traditional Worker Placement - ex: Viticulture (restricted by the places you can visit and players competing for places)
- Worker Placement + Deck Building - ex: Dune Imperium &amp; Lost Ruins of Arnak (adds in a restriction of card locations)
- Bag Building - ex: Orleans (like worker placement, but you are drawing characters out of a bag you are building each with restrictions on where they can be placed)
- Player Board Selection - ex: Scythe (selecting one pair of actions from your board) 
- Action Selection Restricted by Dice Rolling - ex: Khora (select actions based on cards, but you are restricted by what you roll on dice)

A lot of gameplay and puzzle is built on top of the core action selection. But the central puzzle is how you manage your actions economically through their restrictions.

I want to keep each game entirely in one box, but that has become challenging.

The games in question are:

* Firefly the game (current in a clear bin)
* Apples to Apples (currently in a clear bin)
* Elder Sign (overstuffed into original box, with two expansions in their own boxes)

boardgames,Betrayal at the House on the Hill Questions!,False,2,0,"So I recently picked up this game and I have a question. The people I play with just build out the mansion until they find an omen room and walk in and out of the room on their rolls to just stack omen cards to try and proc the haunt asap.

The two times we played the first haunt was the bats, that was over in like 1-2 turns, I lost almost immediately as the traitor. Then the second one was the mummy, another player won that one but it was such a downhill battle for the heroes. The mansion was so tiny the mummy almost won on the first turn of the haunt.

Is this really how the game is meant to be played? I find that we never have time to buff our character stats or build out the mansion or ever find items.

&amp;#x200B;

My second question, when we are playing the game and the haunt begins, if the survivor manual says ""Search the deck and add the kitchen to the mansion"" and it doesn't say that in the traitors manual, when we regroup and start playing the game do the survivors have to tell the traitor what happened during their prep phase?

Having now played a ton of games in a few days, and read around about it online, I am firmly convinced it is more luck than skill.

The moves/strategies you can do to limit or slow your opponent are trivial, whilst the high value cards coming out randomly seem to decide the outcome of the game nearly 100% of the time. 

It's a shame as it initially seemed like exactly what we were looking for.

My review is: luck outweighs skill too much and is therefore more of a children's game than one board game fans can enjoy again and again.

Would love to hear in the comments if you think I missed something though!

boardgames,[COMC] Finished the basement and built a gaming area.,False,315,0,"First and last COMC. I've been in the hobby since 2009.

Last piece of trim went up yesterday, and I thought if I were ever going to share this type of post, this would be the only time. I tried to make the post worthwhile and gave various info. I made a lot of custom stuff in the collection, including storage solutions, a gaming table, terrain, Crokinole board(s), and various other things.[link to game room album](https://imgur.com/a/GpsCxHs)

[edit] the table had my custom blood bowl pitch set up on it for the photo 

# The Project

We live in Wisconsin and went remote full time at the start of the pandemic. At that time none of my basement was finished, and working in a dungeon-like space during the winter months was pretty depressing. To top it off we locked down pretty hard, so I needed something to get me through the January-April months of being locked up inside. So I began finishing the 1200 or so square feet of my house. I did all the wiring, lighting, sheetrock, taping, mudding, painting, floors and finish work: all of it. I wanted a bright, warm feel to the basement where I now spend most of my time. The rest of the space not shown has a pool table and open area for playing room scale VR. Then my office space, workout area and art studio corner. It's all an open room with the posts down the middle.

# Custom made stuff

I posted a few things in the past so here's the info and links.

[Gaming table (not shown)](http://imgur.com/gallery/qsgw0) It's in our dining room and staying there

On the table is my [custom made Blood Bowl pitch](https://imgur.com/a/KSFP5) for the wood elf team ""The Mean Prey Trackers"".

I also make crokinole boards. [Link to a previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/geom55/covid_crokinole_boards_a_diy_report/) And I made a matching carrom board as well.

I designed the banners on the wall. The first has the logo for the league I run, and the other for my team. Printed on vinyl.

# Game Collection info

I used to run a weekly game night and had been doing that for about seven years, but COVID killed it. Consequently my game collection has gone through a bit of turnover. I eliminated some games that just weren't going to get played anymore and picked up more family/casual and ""evergreen"" or ""classic hobby"" games as well as some good soloable titles.

I've condensed the expansions down into one box as much as possible. If a game on the shelf has an expansion it's likely in there.

I tried to arrange the games by shelf, but it's not a perfect system as you fill one and have space elsewhere.

Not shown: Catan, a few smaller games like The Crew, and my painted miniatures cabinet. I have all released blood bowl teams, and I think I'm 3 teams behind in assembling and painting, so I'm doing pretty good with the painting backlog. I also play Marvel Crisis Protocol and pick up most of those releases. Also doing fairly well keeping up on the backlog there.

# Shelves:

Top shelf is basically the heavier or solo games.

Second from the top has most of the family weight, casual games

Third shelf down has more of the ""next step"" middle weight games as well as a few lighter titles

Fourth shelf has the odd box sizes and some random stuff. The one with a lock printed on it is Kingdom Rush. Mechs vs Minions (all painted) and Hoplomachus are obscured in the photo.

bottom shelf: To cull pile and random stuff. A few Magic Commander decks and some pre-built Netrunner decks I assembled.

Floor: Pitch Car tub filled to the brim. A few custom made pieces like my own loop and such.

# Kallax

travel bag on top to carry blood bowl or Marvel minis.

Tube has my custom printed vinyl blood bowl pitches

Batman Gotham City Chronicles: I know it's divisive, but we love it. I have all of the villains painted so far. This game was heading towards the cull list, but the third season has a solo option coming that has kept it on the shelf.

Full collection of Marvel Champions in dividers (hero cards) and encounter cards (card box).

Full Lord of the Rings LCG arranged the same way

Full Netrunner collection: I only bought a few releases for that game, but they made the cards public. I was able to print them for free at my brother's print shop, so it cost me about $100 in sleeves to get the entire collection.

Blood Bowl pitches and rule books

Next to Gloomhaven is my dicemasters storage solution. Each tray pulls out. Dice are arranged at an angle in rows. Dicemasters is probably leaving the collection, tho.

# My personal top ten:

1. Blood Bowl
2. Star Wars Rebellion - would be #1 if I played it as much as Blood Bowl.
3. Gloomhaven
4. A Feast for Odin - purchased in the last year. Rocketed to the top 5. So good.
5. Spirit Island
6. Great Western Trail
7. Lord of the Rings LCG
8. Merchants and Marauders
9. Roll Player
10. Marvel Champions

# Most played:

Lord of the Rings, LCG by a mile

Blood Bowl

Marvel Champions

Gloomhaven

Just One

Codenames

# To cull list:

Paper Dungeons: didn't hit for me

Fallout: I picked up the solo expansion but it's just not a game I wanna pull off the shelf

King of New York

Dice Town

Twilight Struggle: (I know I know, but it's just not being played)

Kingsburg: found it completely boring

Mansions of Madness 2nd edition: the shine wore off so quickly.

Myth: terrible game

Return of the Heroes: outdated

Rising Sun: hated the bidding mechanic

Space Infantry: not my thing

7th continent: I hated the rinse/repeat do everything again thing

Tainted Grail: OMG the story was great but the game part was such a chore.

boardgames,Thoughts on Red Cathedral?,False,6,0,"I've only played this twice, and enjoyed it both times, but the owner has a strategy which won, but threatened to slow the game down if everyone did it.

boardgames,LOOT: A Plundering Pirate Card Game - Review,False,22,0,"Full video review here: https://youtu.be/ww64BtSWRVc

I like pirates, okay, so naturally I'm drawn to pirate games. Theming isn't absolutely vital, else I'd hate Love Letter, but slap a pirate or a galleon on the box and my eye lingers a little longer.

And that, genuinely, was the story with Loot. We had already picked up Sushi Go! and were loving it when I spotted Loot on their promotional insert. Sushi Go! is awesome, I reasoned, surely a pirate game by the same team would be great too?

The price was good, the tin it came in was small enough that shipping wouldn't be an issue so I went for it. A few weeks later, it arrived in Zimbabwe and, well, that's what this review is about...

And yeah, there's probably going to be a Top 5 Pirate Games video or something soon, isn't there?

Ahoy there folks, today I want to introduce you all to Loot, a fast paced plundering pirate card game designed by Reiner Knizia, and published by Gamewright Games, for 2-5 players.

In Loot, each player is a Pirate Lord looking to plunder as much gold as they can and whichever bold buccaneer finishes with the most booty, wins!

As quick as Loot is to play, it's even quicker to teach! To set up, shuffle the deck, deal six cards to each player, and place the remaining deck in the centre.

Your hand will contain a variety of merchant ships, shown by the gold in the corner, pirates of different colours and strengths, along with some special characters if you're really lucky. We'll talk about those more later.

During your turn, you have a single simple decision. Do you draw a card, or play a card?

If you draw a card, your turn ends and play continues with the next player, but if you choose to play a card, well, you have options.

First of all, the merchant ships. If you play a merchant ship to the table, and it's still there, untouched at the start of your next turn, then it has successfully sailed home, laden with doubloons, and you score it and all its gold!

But that's hardly ever going to happen. You see, the purpose of the pirate cards is to sail out and claim the merchant ships.

If there's a merchant ship on the table when it's your turn, you might choose instead to send one of your pirate ships to go and plunder it. You place your pirate ship next to the merchant ship.

Now, at the start of your next turn, if you have the most pirate symbols next to a merchant ship, you plunder it and score that gold! Yarr!

But you're not the only one going after each others gold. Sure, you may have played a pirate on another players merchant ship, but the third player may have pirates of their own to play, as long as they're a different colour to any existing pirates on that ship.

Heck, when it comes back around to it, the player who first played the merchant ship may send out their OWN pirates to secure the booty, assuming they have a third colour of pirate to use! Attacking your own ships seems crazy, but it's a solid way to secure your gold and ensure it makes it back to its possibly rightful owner.

At the start of a players turn, if they have the most pirates on a ship, they score it. If not, it stays down and play continues. Remember, each turn you can either draw a card OR play a card, and this is where things get interesting.

That ship that's locked down in a stalemate... Do you add another pirate to it to strengthen your fleet there? Or do you send out a new load of pirates against another merchant ship that's currently uncontested? Right now, the stalemate isn't likely to break and you're running low on cards, so maybe now's a good time to draw up?

It's all about timing. If you've got the dreaded 8 gold merchant ship, you're going to want to drop that bad boy carefully. Do you wait until your opponents are low on cards, or for them to be distracted by other ships? Or do you wait until you have an ace up your sleeve that might help you claim it yourself if it's contested?

See, there's five more cards we haven't talked about, the Pirate Captains, and the Admiral.

At the start of your turn, you check to see if there are any ships you'd win. If you've got the most pirates on a ship, or if you have an uncontested merchant ship in front of you, you win. But it's not always that simple.

See, if someone plays a Pirate Captain, they've almost certainly won that merchant ship. You can only play a Pirate Captain on matching pirates you own, so it can be tricky to set up, but there's nothing quite as satisfying as having a single pirate on a ship, watching your opponent drop a large four onto it, for you to put the Pirate Captain down and trump them entirely.

Until, that is, in their turn, they ALSO put down a Pirate Captain which trump's yours since it was the most recently played. That's already heartbreakingly hilarious, but it could get worse.

The player who launched that besieged and beleaguered merchant vessel has been strangely calm as you each played your attacks, and now a frankly unsettling grin is beginning to slide across her lips like a clipper through the waves.

Then it happens. She takes a card from her hand, plays it on top of the merchant ship, and cackles. It's the Admiral.

You see, Pirates, as scary and powerful as they are, universally fear only one thing. The Royal Navy, and so the Admiral, playable only on a merchant vessel, trump's all the current Pirate Captains.

Now, it's possible that another player may then play a third Pirate Captain, trumping the Admiral, but at that point I'm pretty sure that someone would have flipped the table into the sea.

Loot is full of these moments. These flashes of competition, of gaining the upper hand only to immediately lose it, of mistiming a valuable merchant ship, or just not having the right colour of pirates to be able to fit into a crowded fight.

Everyone needs to play different coloured pirates when attacking a merchant vessel, else the pirates get really confused as to who's on whose team, you see.

And that's it. It feels a little chaotic in the first round or so, but gameplay and setup are both super quick, so a dummy round is easily shuffled back into the deck to go again for realsies this time.

And the game is so fast paced. Though you only have the one choice each turn, draw a card or play a card, that itself begins a spiral of possibilities. If I draw this turn, will I lose anything? Can I afford to wait to draw later? If I play a card, which ship do I play it on? Do I start out small on that merchant vessel, or do I go big or go home?

I also adore the art on this one. It's this really weird and overblown art style that just fits the gameplay so well. It's hard to be angry that someone plundered your ship when they look like this.

As a game, Loot is delightful.

It's also remarkably vicious, but, in a good way, I think. The game is about pirates swarming merchant vessels, so a small amount of chaos is inevitable, and sure, you're all attacking each other. Sometimes folks will feel ganged up on, a mechanic we normally don't like at all in our group, but in Loot, that's a result of playing your merchant vessels at the wrong time and it invariably swings back around later.

Sure, I've had nothing but merchant vessels to play for the past three turns, sure, every single one of them has been swarmed by pirates, but now? Now I've got the 8 coin merchant vessel and the Admiral to play! Now is my time, haha!!

Oh look, they all had Pirate Captains. Well shi-

So, does Loot join the crew, or do we consign it to an oblivion in Davy Jones locker?

Loot is a gem of a game. It's one of those rare games where theme and gameplay collide into something spectacularly fun, and being so small, so cheap, and so fast paced, makes it an excellent choice for travel, for family, or for filler.

If you're looking for something quick and crazy to play, then Loot may just be it.",,4,,22,,public

You can play as the French, English, or Spanish colonial governor or the micco of the Creek Confederation. It’s a game of resource management and diplomacy, where you will trade and make alliances w smaller American Indian nations to gain an advantage. It’s inspired by the real history of the Southeast, which did involve a complex wheeling and dealing between colonial and indigenous powers.

My question is where do you draw the line on what’s appropriate in a historical game?
Slave raiding and slave revolts were a huge part of the diplomatic and economic interchange of the groups in the game. I kind of want to make slaves or captives an in-game resource and give players a reason to conduct slave raids or arm slave revolts against each other like in real life. The problem is that i worry that people wont be comfortable using slaves as a resource in the game. Maybe it shouldn’t be comfortable 🤷🏻‍♂️ i dont want to whitewash what really happened. I think there should also be an option for a colonial player to wipe out a small tribe like they really did, but again is that too horrible to make it part of the game? Obviously you could choose not to, or to abolish slavery with certain tradeoffs, but is it a problem for it to just be possible?
The game is meant to teach about a dark part of history, but I don’t want it to offend or disgust people. I havent heard anyone complaining that you have to play as nazis in Axis and Allies, though.

The tiles were different, with each giving up to three new directions to go in (e.g. shaped like a ‘+’ or ‘L ‘or ‘l-‘).

Now I'm practicing on [boardgamearena.com](https://boardgamearena.com), meeting and play with people. My win rate is just about 50% now... but FYI. That's not really important.

Okay, now we are in the main part.  
As I knew before, a 2-player game is much more controllable but also harder, and more competitive. Literally battle. My main tactics are mostly:  
1/ ""Hit the (tier) 3"", then move to another color at 2 or 3 tier, collect gems and cards that help and related to other that is necessary to win (a.k.a Sprinter). Weakness are, when I got blocked (crucial in 2-players) I f\*\*\* up, and have to slowly work around, wasting turns.   
2/""Be flexible"" which is dependent on the cards. If it seems to not ""related"" I get stuck and just... work around? 

So I need some advises on:  
1/ The no.1 tactic, what should I do when I got blocked and contingency plans to win?  
2/ Also, another weakness of mine is I reluctant to block other players (I used to do that back then), but how should you block to not choke yourself later on?  
3/ How to be more ""flexible"" in the game?  
4/ Is there any other strategies that I didn't know instead of the ""Hit the 3"" (which seems effective for less turn, high value/points)? Honestly, 4 years ago mostly everyone in our circle play that game and they block each other to prevent that. Yet I want to know some other way too.

boardgames,Vast: The Crystal Caverns,False,10,0,"Two related questions here about this game. But first off, I love Vast: The Mysterious Manor and The Haunted Hallways. The total asymmetry and procedurally-generated board are fun and there's a kind of brilliance to the game that I really like.

Description: 

Size is Standard(65*88mm iirc)

Front is clear, glossy and smooth

Back is just a hint of matte/opaqueness, bears the iconic hologram of Ultra Pro and has a slightly rough feeling

Shuffling is very statisfying and easy




Full Story:
I recently bought Undaunted Normandy and North Africa, used. While the latter was still in wrap, Normandy was already sleeved. 
Alas, the seller cant remember which sleeves he used. Told me it's Mayday Premium but a friend reminded me that the little hologram dot on the back means they are Ultra Pro. 
We cant figure out which of their ~367 different styles of sleeves these are, though

boardgames,Essen 2021 - how did the games I bought there fare?,False,97,0,"Essen 2021 – a haul retrospective

2021 was my first Essen, and I think we can all agree that new people are more prone to excess that those who have been around the block a few times – enter your kind narrator. Given that it was my first Essen, I felt that I had to buy all the games that looked good or otherwise fear that I would never again be able to find them. The FOMO really got to me. Luckily I’ve now seen that not to be the case at all (not even the promos were exclusive to Essen!), meaning that I can go to Essen 2022 with a noticeably lower desire to acquire. However, I thought it might be fun to take a look at the games I bought at Essen 2021 and see how well they fared in my collection. 
For this, I’ll be talking about the games I’ve bought, the number of plays they each had and my reviews in brief. Should you be curious about specific games, feel free to drop a comment. 

**Art Robbery** – 10 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Art Robbery is one of the filler-type games that gets the most play around my house. I’ve got the teach down to a slim two minutes, and I’ve also got the soundtrack down pat. It really is quite Knizia. I still stand by most of the stuff I’ve said in my review, except for the fact that I have had some games of this that were not fun for everyone. I’m A-ok with people consistently stealing my stuff, because I find it hilarious and the game will be over in ten minutes anyway. However, I have had games where people are consistently frustrated that they don’t draw cards that let them do anything they feel is meaningful while consistently getting their stuff stolen. Touch with caution. 

**Golem** - 5 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! I wrote a long piece where I analyzed the cultural history in this game, and I stand by most of what I said there. That said, I have encountered some real problems that stop me from getting it to the table more. The teach is an absolute BEAR, mostly because the game is such an icon soup. I’m also finding that the core gameplay loop is becoming less and less satisfying the more times I play it, because there’s such little interaction. I can see this getting the axe in the future. 

**LUNA Capital**- 5 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! I bought this game mostly because a number of YouTube people were raving about it and I found the artwork cute, but I ended up not liking the core gameplay that much. The tile tower is fiddly, even though you would expect that not to matter that much, and the stuff with the cards… I would just rather be playing Azul, which I feel covers much the same ground while being a lot more streamlined and transparent. Bit of a dud for me, this one. 

**MicroMacro Crime City – full house** - 1 play  
Do I still own it: I do! Mostly because we haven’t really gotten around to playing this one much. I really like MicroMacro though, so I’m just saving this one for a rainy day. I like the little quality of life improvements for families now that they have added little icons that indicate what type of case you can expect, as it helps parents who want to play together with their kids make more educated choices of what type of content they want to expose their kids to. 

**Mindbug** - 4 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! It ended up being too thin for me. The main draw of this game was that it was kind of like squeezing all the water and fat out of Magic the Gathering, ending up with this super sleek game that could be taught and played in mere minutes. For me though, the end result was a game that just didn’t really do much for me. It felt a little bland, like some soul was missing. A soul that can’t be plastered over by any kind of goofy artwork. 

**MOON ADVENTURE** - 7 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! I did really like Moon Adventure, but I just don’t really play that many cooperative games. This one in particular felt really hard to do well, as the Ion Storms can just absolutely mess you up even though you’ve been very careful. I like the core system (which is why I do still own Deepsea Adventure), but this cooperative take did not end up setting my world on fire. 

**Railroad Ink Challenge – Lush Green** - 6 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! I really like this one! Railroad Ink is always nice and mindful, and I’m pretty much always satisfied with the end result. There’s just something very soothing about making a little train route, even though this one does a good job of putting on the pressure more. I personally prefer the trails expansion over the trees expansion, even though both are good. This is also the version of Railroad Ink Challenge that I recommend people get. It’s a good game! 

**SCOUT** - 4 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Scout is just a great, great, great little game, as you may have been told over the last few months. The cardplay feels really fun, I like the theme well enough (my SO and I made it a tradition to tell the other players the names of the cards we’ve played) and there’s something unique about the cards in this game. Recommended, assuming there will be a time where you can actually acquire it. 

**The Siege of Runedar** - 6 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! The Siege of Runedar was REALLY FUN while it lasted though. I didn’t end up falling in love with the core system, and the lack of variability (besides difficulty) ended up killing the game for me. Each game played much too similarly, which ended up with me using the same strategies over and over again. I had my fun exploring the system, so now it’s time to pass it onto someone else. 

**Whitehall Mysteries** - 3 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Whitehall Mysteries, to me, is just the strictly superior version of the Letters to Whitechapel system. It’s lean, it’s easy to understand, it’s quick, it’s incredibly tense; I really do love it a lot. It is currently my favourite hidden movement game, although I’ve heard good things about Sniper Elite and MIND MGMT. I’ve got Beast underway from Kickstarter sometime before December, we’ll wait and see if that game can claim the title. As it stands though, Whitehall Mysteries really is what I love about the system as a whole. It’s tense, excruciating turns followed either by having the cops on your heels or feeling like you’re a criminal mastermind. I cannot recommend this game enough, even though I realize that it is quite difficult to get at the moment.   

**FINAL SCORE**  
Games bought: 10  
Games still in collection: 6  

Not a bad score actually! There’s some games on here that I’m a little salty about (mostly LUNA Capitol) and one that I can see leaving in the not-so-distant future (Golem), but as it stands I do feel that this is a pretty good score. Having said that, I do feel it important to again emphasize (to myself as much as others, to be honest) that Essen should not only be about acquiring new games but also about simply playing and enjoying the con. Last year I went by myself; this year I will be going together with three of my friends. I cannot wait to share this whole new experience with them.

boardgames,Tables: What kind do you play on?,False,3,0,"Setting aside discussion of specialized board game tables, I was wondering what people's thoughts are on table height. I generally play on a rectangular kitchen table with regular kitchen chairs, but that's not the only type of table that I *could* play on.

boardgames,"Twilight Inception - scanned, printed and laminated boards!!",False,0,0,"I saw the post the other day with the game boards covered by a sheet of perspex. I was going to take the plunge and for around £12, it wouldn't be expensive. But, being an awkward bugger got me thinking of another way. This took way longer than I thought it would, but the end result is great.

I scanned the back and front of all 34 boards, totalling 68 images at 300dpi on a flatbed scanner.

Next, I printed out every image on A4 plain printer paper using a colour laser (Brother) at 600x600dpi, which is 'normal' printing quality.

Once that was done, I then used a cheap paper trimmer (guillotine) and cut out each image from the A4 sheets.

I tried to align each of the sheets back to back as per the originals, but it was such a pain and lot of work, I sacked the idea. So, instead I ended up laminating every single one of the 68 images. This took forever. My laminator takes 30-60 seconds per sheet and can't be used for more than 10-15 minutes without cooldown time. Some sheets had to be printed, trimmed and laminated twice because of creases in the laminating pouches when the machine got too hot.

Finally!! I then trimmed off the extra laminating plastic from each sheet and what I ended up with is what you see in the picture.

Honestly, had I known how much of a pita and how long all this was going to take me, I probably would have just bought the bloody perspex sheet. Still, I am very happy with the end result and won't have to use the originals that came with the game. Plus, if any do get damaged from use or wear out, I can print and laminate another copy in a few minutes.

I must be nuts to have done all this, right?!

1. Is there any high-quality images to utilize for the custom box and the look will be very similar with original return-to boxes? Does FFG ever shares some quality sources to make them customizable?

Today I want to talk about **logistics and fulfillment**. This is a large area with particular importance to our backers as it decides whether the games will reach them economically, in good time and in one piece. This was one of the first things we decided to tackle when we started this project and we made a poor choice at first when working through the issues.

To set the scene, we anticipate:

* Our backers will be primarily based in the USA
* Approximately 20-25% of backers will be European/ UK
* Any Oceania based backers we will be able to send directly from our homes in Australia

Initially we did minimal research and met with logistics/ fulfillment partners that were aligned with manufacturers we were talking to based in the USA. Whilst the people at these logistics partners were very helpful to establish some initial thought processes, they were missing key factors that we were not yet aware of. Initially, we selected a provider that we weren’t aware had a less than stellar reputation due to their helpfulness in establishing initial thought processes. What we didn’t realise was that the cost of their service and their reputation for helping our customers was not peak industry standard as we had been searching for. Additionally, they were presenting a USA based only strategy which would mean very expensive fulfillment for our European backers when VAT and higher shipping fees from the USA are taken into account. Ultimately, what we thought would be helpful advice turned out to be more of a sales pitch, perhaps a bit naive from us to expect anything else but the tone of communication presented more friendly than business. 

When we realised our mistake we had to restart the process of choosing a fulfillment provider or providers that were recognised as industry leaders in service and would deliver our games in a good state to our backers. Over the last couple years there has been a huge amount of movement in this industry due to COVID and the war in Ukraine which has made it very difficult to find up to date information.

**USA &amp; NA Fulfillment** 

USA &amp; Canadian fulfillment is a much simpler process than many other places in the world as the import charges are easier to deal with and assistance is readily available from the fulfillment providers. Fulfillment in the US is a highly competitive market with many companies to choose from. Shipping charges are well established, competitive and turnaround times are relatively quick. There are a few providers that are commonly referred to as industry leaders for the Kickstarter space across various articles we found online, in particular Fulfillrite and Quartermaster Logistics. We spoke to both companies and chose to go with Fulfillrite based on the response times we received to our queries, however both companies are very knowledgeable and helpful. Both companies also provided quotes to fulfill games worldwide, however the pricing is far greater than local fulfillment and we therefore chose to split fulfillment with a EU based provider and completing Oceanic fulfillment ourselves. 

**UK &amp; EU Fulfillment**

In particular there has been significant changes to the way VAT is dealt with for imported goods. In order to ensure we were across the recently changed VAT processes for imported goods in the EU we conducted a significant amount of research before contacting EU based fulfillment providers. In particular the Stonemaier games articles, whilst now out of date, provided an excellent starting point for this. I’ll link them below:

https://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter-lesson-47-this-project-is-eu-friendly/ 

Upon contacting our chosen European fulfillment partner they provided us with some extremely useful information in relation to the requirements for VAT on Kickstarter fulfillment for creators outside the EU, in particular for fulfillment from the UK. Below is the key passage as I had difficulty finding this information up-to-date elsewhere. 

*VAT in the UK: The UK now requires all publishers outside of the UK who are making sales to UK backers to become VAT registered in the UK, charge the appropriate VAT at point of Sale, then report this back to HMRC on a quarterly basis. You will also be required to obtain a UK EORI (Economic Operators Registration and Identification) Number to allow import into the UK. VAT registration in the UK is relatively simple with your application and quarterly reporting all being made online through the government gateway platform. There is no cost associated with registration or filing.

VAT in the EU: The EU also requires the charging of VAT at point of sale to all customers in the EU at the applicable regional rates.

A new system has been introduced to assist publishers with the collection and reporting of this VAT known as IOSS (Import One Stop Shop) – Under this system you are required to register and report your Sales VAT for all orders under 150EUR on a monthly basis. This registration will then allow you to send parcels from the UK to EU with no additional customs charges at the border. Shipments over 150EUR Value will be required to ship via a DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) service with the Sales VAT paid at the border by the courier directly and charged back to you.*

The EU Registration for IOSS is unfortunately more complicated than for the UK and requires fiscal representation in the EU to complete and provide your monthly filing, this does work out to be quite expensive.

Luckily, many fulfillment providers are now offering a service to submit EU VAT returns on creators behalf so that EU VAT registration is not required. This means that the VAT registration fees that would usually be required to be maintained to transact in Europe are able to be covered by the fulfillment provider. In the case of UK shipments, VAT declarations are required to be undertaken to HRMC quarterly by the seller (in this case, us), however there is no cost associated with this unless VAT has been collected in that quarter. In our case this made EU friendly fulfillment a reality, as the costs and processes to establish an EU entity and register for EU VAT would otherwise be prohibitive for our margin. 

**How do I become EU friendly and what does that even mean?**

EU friendly shipping means that packages in EU are delivered on a DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) basis. VAT &amp; import charges are collected prior to the package being sent to the purchaser and remitted on their behalf so that these changes are not required to be settled in order to receive the package on their end. This requires either:

* Registering for VAT in your own right, which comes with a monthly registration fee and likely accountants fees to arrange remittance of these charges
* Arranging for someone else to emit these charges on your behalf (if possible)

In our case, as described above, our UK &amp; EU fulfillment partner is arranging for the remittance of these charges on behalf of our backers. 

Often the phrase EU friendly shipping is associated with shipping from an EU location to limit the shipping expense, whilst this isn’t actually included in the original definition it will likely be required in order to properly deal with VAT on an EU friendly basis, as is the case with our campaign. 

**Our key learnings**

* The providers in this space are the best place to get current information. Whilst there is a bit of irony in me saying this in a post sharing our experiences, the logistics and fulfillment industry changes very rapidly and articles online quickly become out of date. Contacting providers directly gave us a far better picture than trying to research purely online, in particular providers we found that had a good reputation with other board game publishers. 
* Even though the fulfillment cost is largely borne by the backers, it’s still a significant gate in whether they will back the game and needs to be treated with respect. Our initially chosen provider would have meant that the cost of our game to backers outside the US would be roughly double, with the cost of shipping being almost as much as the game for EU based backers. This potentially would be a blocker for 20-25% of our backers who are anticipated to be outside the US, ultimately affecting our profitability due to potentially decreased manufacturing numbers. 
* Despite first impressions, including EU based fulfillment is actually an economically viable option. It felt easy at the start to write off EU based fulfillment due to the complexities, but working through the issues will help us run a successful (hopefully!) campaign.

boardgames,How do you guys play mafia (werewolf)?,False,5,0,"So some people brought the mafia game from Russia to our country and opened a club and a league for that. They claim they are playing the official competitive version with World Competition rules:  


* The game is for exactly 10 + Moderator
* It always has the same roles: 5 townsmen, 1 Sherif, two regular mafias, and a Don(mafia's boss)
* On the first night, the don decides with the mafia on who to kill (static or by the pattern for the advanced player)
* During the day everyone has one minute to talk; they are not allowed to talk outside of their minute
* during the night the mafia marks the Moderator who they kill without opening their eyes. if they don't choose the same person they miss and no one dies.
* Also, during the night the Sherif can search for the mafia and the Don for the Sherif.
* From the second we can start eliminating people, everyone must vote at the end of the round.
* Talking out of your time, touching, cursing, be emotional gives you a strike. on 3 strikes you are losing your minute on four you are out.
* Strike during the night count as four strikes.

The game is over when there are no more mafias, or the mafia is equal to the number of players.  
So I looked for a kit for that and found only mafia games with a lot of roles and very different from what we played...

boardgames,"Name some favorite games that ""bombed"" when you played them with a gaming group!",False,41,0,"I have several favorite games that I can only play with certain groups of people or individuals bcause something about the theme or gameplay turns players off completely. 

My first example is 'The Bloody Inn.' I love the story of a sinister family of hotel owners in competition to scheme with or murder their guests for the most profit. The theme was too dark for one of the groups I played with and they resented that once you reached the top of the money track, you had to spend a turn ""laundering,"" money into franc tokens so you could make more. 

Second is 'Galaxy Trucker,' which left several players furious when the randomness of the asteroid collisions decimated a ship they had been painstakingly crafted well past the timer ( I was lax on the timer rules since it was a first play). As a result, they claimed the game was pointless. I love the nail-biting chaos that results from watching your hastily-made ship come apart in the most hilarious ways, but to each their own. 

And finally, 'Shadows of Malice.' I've never been able to get anyone else into this game. They either hate how sparse and symbol-heavy the artwork is, or they don't have any interest in the mechanics and random monster generator. This one I at least understand, since it is a rather crazy set of rules and relies on the players' imagination and ability to embrace the theme.

**Arkham Horror LCG** - the chaos bag; essentially a modular 16-sided die, the chaos bag allows for customizable difficulty. There is something so exhilarating about groping in the bag before drawing, knowing that I'm brushing against success and failure, and that I control which destiny I pull. The clackity-clack of coin capsules makes this experience even better! The game itself is great, but the chaos bag makes it one of the best of all time.

**Spirit Island** - the invader track; allows the players to see into the future and anticipate invader actions before they act, allowing you to optimize every move and plan for their demise with meticulous glee.

boardgames,"Games where you build something (landscapes, towns, patterns) - which games are your favorites and why?",False,23,0,"I really love games where I can build or create something. It can be in a more abstract sense, e.g. engine building (Race for the Galaxy, Terraforming Mars), or more literal, where you create a landscape, like Cascadia. I wanna talk about the latter. Disclaimer: this is all very subjective and when I'm critical of ones aspect of a game, it doesn't mean I don't like the game (e.g. Terraforming Mars) or not even that I don't like the look overall (e.g. Everdell might be the best looking game I have).

Over time I noticed a a few preferences of mines: 

1. Obviously a game has to be sound mechanically and be fun, but aesthetics are really important to me. Take **Terraforming Mars** or the map in **Ark Nova**, for example. It gets the job done, but it isn't fun to look at it. TM also lacks variety (ocean, greenery, city). **Cascadia** is nothing groundbreaking in this regard, but it's nice to look at and I enjoy figuring out how to place the next tile. 

2. The (subjectively) right theme makes a big difference, too. **Azul** looks fantastic, but what am I even doing? IIRC it is about producing tiles, however, it doesn't matter for the gameplay, I'm just putting the tiles where they need to go with little rhyme or reason. It's not satisfying. Games like **Cascadia** (nature + animals) and **Kingdomino** let me build a landscape. **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** lets me build a castle and even if I think it could look nicer, 

3. A downside of all this is that disturbing the pattern, even if advantageous gameplay-wise, is unsatisfying. When playing **Kingdomino** I always shied away from taking the swamp(?) tiles, i.e. the light brown ones. I often just call it ""mud"". 

4. Despite #3, I much prefer games where it's possible to ""screw up"" like this over games where I don't care if I interrupt a pattern. Because if I don't care about it, it also means I don't enjoy making these patterns in the first place. Maybe not the perfect example, but **Kanagawa** fits the bill for me. The cards are nice, but I find myself somewhat indifferent to the painting I'm creating. **Everdell** looks amazing, but the town I'm building...well, visually it doesn't feel like I'm building a town, I'm putting cards down next to each other.

boardgames,Azul: how do I calculate probability of a factory having at least 3 blues?,False,13,0,"I started wondering this today but I haven't touched this kind of math for quite a while...

Say, with the initial board setup with 2 players (20 per color, 5 factories).

What's the probability of having at least one factory with at least 3 blues?

I think I know how to calculate for the first factory (choosing 4 tiles from a 100):

(20 choose 3) \* (80 choose 1) / (100 choose 4) + (20 choose 4) / (100 choose 4)

But with 4 other factories, it seems to get complicated.

Ultimately, I'd like to generalize it to any board setup. Say, in second round, with a distribution of \[16, 17, 15, 12, 20\], probability of at least k etc.

**Edit:** Wow. Thanks for your wonderful answers. That was a fun thought exercise. TLDR seems like a hard problem and writing a simulation is the easiest. Will write one and report back.  
**Edit 2:** For those interested, as suggested, I wrote a simple program to simulate a 2p board of azul and gotten the following probability after sampling 20 tiles from 100 tiles for 10M times.

\- number of factories that have at least 2 blues: 8878900 (17.76%)  
**- number of factories that have at least 3 blues: 1223261 (2.45%)**  
\- number of factories that have at least 4 blues: 61944 (0.12%)

boardgames,"[Tabletop Sim] Introducing ""Shrapnel!"", my own free card war boardgame",False,26,0,"Hello folks.

This week I was bored out of my mind and playing Sid Meier's Gettysburg, and decided to do something with all that excitement.

Here be Shrapnel!, my first ever boardgame, and one that I am proud of. The pitch would be: *""Deploy your Napoleonic Era unit cards in a 6x6 grid, where facing, flanking and terrain are the name of the game. With unique cards representing seven different nations, a game of Shrapnel! can be resolved to its bloody conclusion in just under 30 minutes.""*

Because I just want people to try it, it's not printed or anything -- yet! Here's a [Tabletop Simulator link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2866775752) for people to give it a shot (pun not intended). Of course, game's totally free, I earn nothing, all images are credited. I hope you guys enjoy playing it as much as I did making it.

I made a video tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/nwxx5AXzGZM) to explain the setup and first turn.

Can someone help me give a clear reason or otherwise a lot of examples of why it isn’t necessary to have tokens for complexity! Thanks and appreciation in advance to any responses!

Edit: it seems the term my friend was referring to was a chit, and that overall their argument was for naut as they called any chitless game I offered too simple so I think it was just a bad faith argument in the first place, sorry to have taken up space on this subreddit with something so redundant and I also apologise for my lack of board game knowhow, I’m new to anything more complex than the most well known or basic games &lt;3",,17,,0,,public

boardgames,What makes a game a Halloween Game?,False,3,0,"Avalon is - the treachery and evil being distinctly Halloweenesque but a similar treachery in Mafia de Cuba isn't, though treachery, deceit and murder still feature.  

Broom Service does feel Halloweeny - even though you are not doing anything scary/ spooky/ evil in the game, just that it's based around witches. Conversely, Quacks of Quedlinburg, despite being wizards putting things into cauldrons - very Halloween - doesn't.   

In the fantasy genre, it's even more subtle. ""Welcome To the Dungeon"" feels Halloween - creeping into a deep dark dungeon with goblins and skeletons in it but Descent obviously isn't, despite going into a deep dark dungeon with goblins and skeletons. 

Some games are 'Halloween feeling' because they 'feel' scary, dark, spooky, tense, and others do just because of the theming.  

Is anybody picking up what I'm putting down?  What makes some games with death/dark/violent/spooky themes or activities feel Halloweeny and others not?",,12,,3,,public

##FAQ

**I live in Haiti/Canada/Costa Rica/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the Nigerian prince won't answer my emails anymore!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on WAAAGH!, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

boardgames,Trying to find out the name of this marble based game - any help would be great!,False,15,0,"Hi! My dad has been on the search for the name of this board game forever. He’s tried Googling it and has found nothing. I’ve also tried googling it and found nothing.

He thinks it might be Italian but that’s the only clue we have and could be wrong.

It’s a long board with 14 marbles on each side and it has marble-shaped holes drilled all down the length of the board in rows. It starts with each side having a row of 5, then 4, and then 5 again from the bottom of each side of the board. (It could be 4-3-4 but I think it’s 5-4-5.) The board then continues in alternating rows of 5 and 4 holes all the way to the other side.  

The goal is to get your marbles on the other side, but you can only move a marble by one space or by bouncing your marbles over other marbles. If there’s a long chain, your marble has unlimited bounces and can bounce over the other side. You can bounce over your own marbles or the other persons.

I was wondering if any of you had any recs with games similar to these two, either card supported, board, drawing.etc. where the narrative build-up with prompts takes more importance than a clear win/lose scenario, but that isn't a pure rpg.

Context: in both these games the main mechanic is getting a prompt from a card to further the story, add more context to the character you might be playing, or the world building (with the quiet year also being supported by map-drawing)

boardgames,Tips and advice for a after school board games club,False,34,0,"Hello all, as the title suggests I'm hoping to run an after school board games club. The session will be roughly an hour and 15 minutes, once a week. 

Some background: I work at a UK school, and the club will be aimed at key stage two (7-10 years old roughly). 

I just wanted some ideas, advice and any board game recommendations that I haven't thought of myself.

Obviously my first session will be more about getting to know the kids, their experiences and what they've played and anything they'd like to try. I will also be writing a contract with some simple guidelines and expectations as a lot of the games will be from my own collection. 

The games that I own and I am thinking of using are: 
Dobble 
Speedy words 
Cobra paw 
Timeline 
Anomia 
Dominoes 
Top trumps 
Guess who 
Colour brain 
Herd mentality 
Word on the street 
Abalone 
Machi koro 
Love letter 
Marrakech 
Codenames 
5 second rule 

If you can suggest any others that would be great. I am of course going to have the basic and easy to play games like snakes and ladders, etc. As each week I will focus on introducing one new game and teach it to a group and then help them to teach it to the other members.",,16,,34,,public
boardgames,Kemet Blood and Sand components question,False,4,0,"hello,

I recently acquired a new copy of Kemet Blood and Sand. Most everywhere I have seen, the rule book and back of the box lists ""5 Player Aids"" included. edit: the back of my retail box also says ""5 Player Aids"" included

However, my retail copy only came with 3 Player Aids and the included rule book only lists 3 Player Aids in the components.

Has anyone else experienced this? I know on the KS Page, Matagot/Asmodee lists ""5 Player Aids in the core box"" so I am a bit confused.

Any info appreciated, thanks.

boardgames,What's your favourite (base) Root faction? And which do you think is most beginner friendly?,False,7,0,"I've been wanting to pick up Root for a while, but I live in Zimbabwe so games cost a lot more (since we have to ship them from the UK) - but I love both the concept and the production values/art of it.

In short, I'm not sure my group will ""handle"" Root since, from what I've read, it's a pretty complex game and our group prefers smaller, lighter games. That said, one of our friends, and my wife, enjoy deep tactical experiences, so who knows?

I just grabbed the digital version and am really enjoying running the tutorials to teach myself the factions. Just curious as to which faction you enjoy most, and which you think is most beginner friendly!",,18,,7,,public
boardgames,I suck. Any sites where I can watch / learn to improve?,False,7,0,"Im terrible at games and I want to improve. I thought, well maybe if I watched someone good, i could see what they do.

I want a site (youtube etc) where i can watch someone play. I dont want to learn the rules (plenty of resources for this) but I want to just watch them play and say what their idea/plan/strategy is as they play.

Any ideas?

Edit: Any improvement on any game could help. Even the basics like Catan, Ticket to Ride, Carcossone, would help. It seems no matter what game, despite the genre, i always lose",,22,,7,,public
boardgames,Great Western Trail 2E “Grinder” Action,False,12,0,"Today ended a ridiculously high scoring game: 155 to 128. I used the “grinder” action (back up the train to run a cow over) to whittle down my starter deck to 1 of each cow except 2 Galloways to get a little extra cash at the hiring market. Within a short time, between ribbons and my thin deck I was scoring a minimum 19 points every time I made it around the board. 

When we were picking up, I noticed the grinder icon in 2E doesn’t have a -1 cost… it appears it pays you a coin! Is that correct?  (I can’t find my rule book.)

Was also curious what people think about the 2E balance on the ribbons, engineers and grinding mechanics. At least in 2P, I felt like scoring early engineers and ribbons gave me a run away victory.",,10,,12,,public

boardgames,Wits and wagers rule interpretation help,False,1,0,"4 people are playing. We had 4 guesses recorded, with the highest guess being 31, and the next highest 18. Everyone wagered on 18. The answer was exactly 31. 

This started a ferocious family fight. I think that no one should win anything, but half the family thinks that because the WAGERS were on a card “closest without going over,” we should all win. (And 31 is only the winning slot if someone wagered on it.)

Does anyone have any proof that is the wrong interpretation? They refuse to believe the rules because it’s vague what “guess” means.",,6,,1,,public
boardgames,Pax Games comparison in 2022,False,14,0,"Hi All,

I have Pamir 2e and have really enjoyed it... Will happily play anywhere from 3-5p, haven't done 2p or with the automa.

Given that this is a reimagined version of the original and is meant to be more accessible, and I've enjoyed it more than enough, I'd like to get ONE of the original 3 pax games (Porf, Pamir 1e, ren 1 or 2e). Did some searching on the sub and there's some info/discussion, but a lot of it is old and doesn't account for either both new 2es, other game releases, etc.

I'm guessing that Pamir 1e wouldn't be worth it since I have 2e, but could someone compare/contrast the games so that I can decide which of Porf and ren (or another) is right for me/anyone else who is interested? Since Pamir is great 3-5 I'm leaning Ren, as people seem to think it's best 2-3 and doable at 4... but a lot of people also seem to think Porf is also fine at 2 and more fun to play! Just not sure which way to go.

Thanks in advance.",,30,,14,,public
boardgames,Gloomhaven too hard? What are we doing wrong?,False,53,0,"Hey, as the game is free to play on Epic right now, my gf and I used this opportunity to try it out before buying it for the collection. We played the tutorials and thought we got most of the mechanics (which evidently was not the case, as we had a few misplays due to poor understanding of rules). First try was at Normal difficulty and we had pretty much no chance. Started with -4hp road encounter and could just open the last door before collapsing. 

Second try I changed it to Easy and houseruled, that \*0 and \*2 were removed from the Modifierdeck (we got fucked over hard with the constant negative modifiers). As we knew what to expect in the first dungeon, we finished it successfully, but only barely. Mainly the last Archer went before me with a low initiative and got a +2 modifier, hitting me for 5 which I could not prevent (2 cards for the turn, no card active, only one card disabled). I would have had two more turns (this and next) and could have looted the treasure but alas my gf had to finish the archer and the last skeleton.

The next dungeon was even more frustrating. Multiple times our strategies were disrupted. We are getting immobilized while the boss ports around the room, fine. Got rid of the archer and wanted to lay on the boss, he then spawns a skeleton with ini 10 or so in the exact spot where I wanted to jump to, sigh. While he attacked twice between the first and second door, he then proceeds to immediately open door 3 and 4 after it. We could not keep up with his movement. Got back to him eventually, he tries to open a fifth door (wtf), we thought he would probably do nothing, but no, he ported again to the opposite site of the room. At this point we were just frustrated and that the modifiers were fucking with us again did not help either.

I mean sure, maybe it was bad luck. But it was on Easy and we spend a good while to determine our turns, this should not be this hard. Also it seems the Modifierdeck is just one more thing which is negative for the players, as the + are useless when you want to kill something (it just leads to overkill damage). We now know what happens again, but it can't be expected from the player to play every scenario twice. Also I am not even sure that we can beat it with our current setup (Brute and Mindthief), as we are neither mobile nor good with AoE. We thought of 1-2 possible strategies afterwards but they also could be easily disrupted again.. Is it easier with four characters instead of two? Please tell us, what we are missing because as of now, it feels not good to waste 2h due to RNG and we are debating to pick it up again.",,107,,53,,public

boardgames,First Outfoxed game with my 4 year old daughter,False,15,0,"Bought my daughter outfoxed for her birthday last week. Read the rules today and she was very excited to play.

boardgames,Im doing a competition with my friends and we are making a card game or board game and rate my idea,False,0,0,"So my Idea is called Africa's Meltdown Showdown. It is a game where you are the owner of a nuclear power plant company and you want to make power plants all over South Africa. However, there are other companies that want to do the same.

You begin by drawing a card which has a country in South Africa on it. This will be your starting area. Each country has a certain trait which will affect how well you do or what will happen. For example, Zimbabwe might have double the chance to survive Nuclear Meltdowns or Madagascar has half a chance of surviving a meltdown.

The way you win is by getting points. Points are earned by having a nuclear reactor in another country or stopping a nuclear meltdown aswell as other ways. However you can loose points by having nuclear meltdowns, failing safety inspections or causing damage to the environment and getting caught doing it. Game ends once every has had 10 turns.

On a turn, a player will perform an action like repairing a nuclear power plant, making sure the power plant meets the safety quotas, buying a power plant in another country and dump nuclear waste. To buy a power plant, it costs them money which they earn every turn however other things costs money too. The players can get another action point when they own a country that gives them one because of traits. On every players turn, they must also take a card that will trigger a random event. Events can be meltdowns, large amounts of nuclear waste, fines or protests against nuclear power.

Explanations of events:
Nuclear Meltdown: One of the reactors in one of your countries fail, any bonuses you earn from that country stops affecting you until repairs are made. Other players can buy any country this happens in and become their property. 

Large amounts of nuclear waste: The people responsible for taking care of waste called in sick and now there is a large amount of waste, you must either pay to dispose of it legally or dump it and risk getting caught and fined for illegally dumping waste.

Fine: Environmental Nut Dan claims you have broken a policy and the government believes him. You are fined 'x' for doing so and must pay or loose the nuclear plant. If you loose the nuclear plant, other plays may buy this and it becomes their property.

Protests: The locals has a changed of heart about nuclear power and want you gone. The government feels forced to take action in favour of them. You automatically loose this country and it becomes locked to everyone.

There are good events as well like a country that is unoccupied becomes interested in your nuclear power and the costs of buying that country is reduced to half its original price.

Anyways thats it. Theres a bunch more to it but its mainly boring details and I wanted to gice a small idea of the game, dont ask why its set in South Africa. Any ideas for traits or random events then comment and I will begin reading them later. Please lemme know and thank you for reading this. In case this type of thing has been made before which I shan't check, let me know so I can edit to make changes for more of an original idea.",,3,,0,,public

Even the lightest of games turns into a slog.

The other stalls with massive AP, and will often rewind moves (sometimes 2-3 times) to min max the outcome before he passes.

boardgames,Tiny Epic Dinosaurs - Review &amp; Video,False,8,0,"(Full video review here: https://youtu.be/VGKIzECPKHk)

Tiny Epic Dinosaurs is a worker placement game designed by Scott Almes, and published by Gamelyn games, where 1-4 ranchers compete to create and operate a dinosaur ranch.

In Tiny Epic Dinosaurs, players will be trying to construct a secure ranch, in which to place, feed, and breed a variety of dinosaurs to supply various contracts. They'll be researching new dinosaurs and various technologies to assist with the process, carefully balancing the need to enclose and feed these creatures.

Of course, nothing is ever that simple, and it's all too easy to slip up, letting dinosaurs escape, break the barricades, or even eat each other.

Let's take a look.

I'm a huge fan of the Tiny Epic series of games. The games themselves are all incredibly well designed with gripping rules across a variety of themes and gaming genres. Each of them is a Big Box Game experience, crammed into a tiny box that's stuffed to the lid with high quality components, which makes them perfect for our groups. Remember, I have to ship my games from the UK, so size and weight are huge cost factors for us. That often means we're stuck with smaller, lighter games.

Not so with the Tiny Epic games, and Tiny Epic Dinosaurs is absolutely no exception.

Inside the box are literally hundreds of teeny tiny wooden screen cut dinosaurs and other detailed components, from the ranchers that you use to carry out various tasks, to the meat, veg, and crate markers used to track your resources. Even the turn marker is this tiny little coffee mug that says, adorably, I LOVE DINOS.

The game board, if you can really use that term, is constructed from several sturdy cards that are double sided to vary the game based on player count. There are stacks of small cards used for research and contracts, and finally, there's a small screen printed dice for wrangling.

Gamelyn Games do also sell a neoprene playmat to help organise the cards and make it look prettier. We don't have it, and whilst it looks awesome, it does add an extra component to the game that massively increases the amount of stuff you need to transport and store, but I suppose it does also protect the cards if you're playing on rougher tabletops.

The fact that this all comfortably fits in the box is a constant source of astonishment, but I did grab this excellent plastic insert from a German company called Feldherr, and I honestly can't imagine life without it as it keeps everything neatly separated, reducing set up and clear up times, and smoothing the game experience too.

Set up is pretty easy. You set out the board depending on the number of players, hand each player a ranch card and a player card, along with a set of tracking pieces and a matching set of workers.

With the Deluxe Edition, there's also this laboratory card that adds a small twist to the gameplay. We'll talk more about this later.

Each player is given a secret private contract, and a small starting amount of resources based on who the first player is. Then the game starts.

At the start of each round, each ranch generates resources based on the number of resource icons still visible. Here you can see the ranch naturally generates one supply crate, three meat, and five veg. As the game continues and players fill their ranches with dinosaurs, these icons will be blocked off and so won't generate resources.

Players go around the table assigning ranchers to various tasks. Sometimes you want to build some barriers to construct enclosures. Sometimes you need some extra food to ensure everyone is fed. Sometimes you want to grab some of the research cards. Sometimes you want to fulfil a contract and hand in some dinosaurs to nab some victory points.

Now, of course, you can't hand in a contract if you don't have the dinosaurs yet, so you'll need to wrangle some.

On this card, you can spend resources to grab a specific dinosaur, or you can attempt to wrangle one. Wrangling doesn't use resources but it does sometimes have some unexpected results based on this dice roll.

If it's a net, congratulations, you wrangled a dinosaur. If you roll an egg, congratulations, you actually wrangled two! Sometimes this can be awesome as it helps you get your ranch running quicker, but sometimes it's the absolute worst, especially if you're running low on food or space!!

Finally, if you roll a claw symbol, then the dinosaur and the rancher are moved to medical leave. We assume the poor guy got stepped on or something.

Medical Leave isn't actually as bad as it sounds. You'll get your rancher back at the end of the turn, and you'll still get the dinosaur, and there are even some cards and abilities that trigger when your workers return from medical... but your worker is no longer blocking the wrangling space.

In many worker placement games, when a worker is assigned to a task, that's it. Nobody else can do it. In Tiny Epic Dinosaurs, a blocked space can still be used, assuming the player who wants to use it assigns more ranchers. If there's one guy already on the task, other players who want to use it will have to assign two ranchers, and so on.

It's worth noting that your Lead Rancher, this big guy, counts as two ranchers for the purposes of assigning and blocking. He can be very useful in a pinch!

Once all players have assigned their ranchers to tasks and collected the various cards, resources and Dinos they've earned, everyone collects up their ranchers and proceeds to arrange their ranch.

When you look at a ranch card, you'll see it has water and mountains. These already provide natural barriers to enclose dinosaurs, but you'll undoubtedly need some barricades to finish the enclosures. Enclosures can only contain dinosaurs of the same type, so you can't put a velociraptor in the same enclosure as a stegosaurus *** and you can't even put a stegosaurus and a brachiosaurus together.

If you cannot place a dinosaur into an enclosure, it escapes, and we'll talk more about escapes later on.

Once all of your barriers and dinosaurs have been happily placed, players must feed all of their dinosaurs. Stegosaurus and Brachiosaurus eat one or two veg each, respectively; and Velociraptors and Allosaurus eat one or two meat each respectively.

You must attempt to feed all of your dinosaurs and if you cannot feed a dinosaur, it escapes.

Finally, any fed dinosaur in an enclosure with another of the same type will breed. So these two, having been fed, will breed a third dinosaur. This doesn't have to be fed, but if you can't place it, it also escapes.

At this point it should be fairly apparent that it's pretty easy for dinosaurs to escape if you've not planned carefully!

Or if you're me, even careful planning isn't enough. I have a love-hate relationship with this die, and I inevitably screw something up...

If a dinosaur escapes, one of two things happen. If it was a carnivore, it eats one of your other dinosaurs on the way out. This sounds bad, but it can actually be useful if you need to thin the populations in your ranch. You can even use it to stop another Dino escaping.

If a herbivore escapes, it smashes down a barricade on the way out. Again, this sounds bad, but it won't necessarily screw you over. If you ended the Arrange Ranch phase with most of your Dino's enclosed, they won't escape if the barriers later break, but it may stop them breeding.

I guess they don't like being watched??

Each dinosaur escape penalty can only be applied once. So if you have an entire heard of stegosaurus escape, you'll still only lose a single barrier. Then, if you can't feed a Brachiosaurus later and it escapes, it won't take another barrier with it. So it's not too bad.

And that's basically it. You refresh the board and do this a total of five more times, then the game ends.

Now during later turns, there are some other things that may happen. Once you have a few dinosaurs in your ranch, you may be starting to eye up some of those contracts. If you have the right dinosaurs in your ranch, you can hand them in to complete a contract, and at this time, you may also complete that Private Contract you were given earlier. But only if you're also completing a Public Contract.

This is where the real difficulty comes into the game. On one hand, you want to hand your Dino's off quickly to secure the contract you want before someone else claims it. You'll also want to hand in those food guzzling Dino's quickly before your ranch is simply overrun. Also, contracts are worth more than the Dino's spent on them, and will free up space for you to continue breeding.

Hand in too quick, however, and your ranch will be left empty, with no dinosaurs left to build towards other contracts forcing you to start from scratch.

The real genius moment is when you realise you can hand in a load of contracts, and still have enough dinosaurs to breed and keep your ranch running, but it's a real knife-edge sometimes, and there's nothing worse than hanging back just long enough for the player before you to steal the contract you need, the only one you could fulfil, leaving you with a burgeoning ranch of hungry Dino's and not enough feed to keep it going.

This happens astonishingly frequently. At least, if you're me.

We touched on the research cards briefly earlier, but these are some of my favourite things in Tiny Epic Dinosaurs. Sometimes these are useful tools like a security force that captures escaping dinosaurs, or stronger barriers that don't break. Sometimes they're endgame tools that give bonus points if certain conditions are met.

But sometimes, they're special unique dinosaurs with really cool abilities.

The Triceratops, for example, may take a LOT of veg to feed, but it scores additional points based on other dinosaurs around it.

The Pterodactyl is cheap to feed and can be paid in meat to transfer dinosaurs from your holding area to the ranch so that you can hand them in for contracts the same turn you wrangled them.

Everyone's favourite, the T-Rex is a beast to feed, but worth a good deal of points and... Perhaps worryingly... You can feed spare Dino's to it instead, and actually earn some meat in the process. Grim, but efficient.

These special dinosaurs don't even need to be properly enclosed, which is awesome, and there's tonnes of variety to keep you going!

At the start of your fourth turn, you also gain an extra rancher and another private contract, which helps up the tension in those later rounds too!

Eventually, the sixth turn ends, and players tally up their points based on their contracts, their research cards, and any dinosaurs left in the ranch. The player with the most points wins!

Tiny Epic Dinosaurs is actually a really straightforward game to play, but there's a lot of possibilities. From turn to turn you'll be trying to balance your need for more dinosaurs, alongside the barriers to enclose them and food to feed them.

It constantly feels like you're always on the verge of running out of something, and play moves swiftly from player to player so you never end up with that situation where you take your turn then end up waiting ages before you can do anything else.

The Tiny Epic games are great for this. Every one of them has all players focused on the board at all times, engaged and present. There's also very little competitive gameplay, you're never attacking another player or purposefully messing with each other, which is a real plus for a group like ours. We don't like that aggression. We don't mind competing, but being able to gang up on another player is a mechanic we don't like. And it doesn't happen here at all.

Now, in the Deluxe Edition, you also get the laboratory expansion, also available direct on the Gamelyn Games website. With this mini expansion, each of the task boards has a number of science tokens on it. If you place a worker on that card, you must take a token, then advance your microscope along the corresponding line. This will occasionally earn you rewards, and like the wrangling die, this can sometimes be an awesome addition that you're aiming for, or sometimes a bonus free dinosaur that you just didn't really want and now you have to enclose it, feed it and URGH.

If you only have the base version though, don't worry too much. Whilst our group tends to use the laboratory mini expansion now, we played it for a long time without it and loved the game. It adds another micro layer to the game that players have to consider, but it's fairly unobtrusive. Playing with it is awesome, but the game doesn't lose much at all without it, and I'm sure there are folks out there who prefer just the base game.

At this point, I ask the question, ""Does Tiny Epic Dinosaurs join our crew, or do we make it walk the plank?"" and this is an easy recommendation.

For us, the tiny box and cheap price made it easy to ship, and it's a great game to shove in a bag when we head up to Msuna or somewhere. But that tiny box contains a huge game packed with top quality components. The game is easy to play, easy to teach, has very little downtime between turns, and great fun for everyone involved.

Sure, it doesn't have the whole Jurrassic Park flavour of the dinosaurs escape and eat everyone, it's much more of a pastoral affair where the focus is on setting up a well-running ranch, but I actually prefer it for this. It's a fairly chill farming game, but with dinosaurs, and what's not to love about that??

If you're after a non-aggressive tabletop experience, or just something to appease the dinosaur loving child inside all of us, then Tiny Epic Dinosaurs is well worth your time.",,2,,8,,public

boardgames,Legendary Encounters Alien - Not sure about a second play,False,4,0,"My wife and have been enjoying deck building games. Clank!, Clank! In Space, and Star Realms have been replayed a ton in the couple of months since we got into the hobby.

She read about Legendary Encounters and heard the Alien version was generally regarded as one of the better ones so we picked it up off eBay.

Upon opening it up we were a bit overwhelmed by the contents. The amount of cards wasn't the issue, it was the contempt the game maker seemed to have for the players by not making the backs of cards that belong in separate decks different colors. In addition, the rule book does a poor job of explaining the various decks. We found a great guide on the internet to get things organized and ready to play. Without that guide I shudder to think how long setup would have taken.

By the time we had things organized we decided not to play that evening since it was such a slog.

We got back to it a day or two later and played a round after watching some videos on YouTube to get the general gameplay mechanics down.

We never felt enjoyment from the round we played. The rules were vague in some areas and it took us a bit to figure out a couple things after reading particular rules a few times. The lack of variety in the deck building cards made turns feel repetitive and uninteresting for the most part.

I was unharmed at one point and a couple turns later was dead do to some unfortunate timing some cards came out, which I didn't actually mind as it made the scenario feel more realistic in some ways. We are battling an Alien after all.

My wife ended up winning by the skin of her teeth and the last couple of turns leading up to the win were the best part of the session since there definitely was some suspense as to whether she'd pull it off or not.

It's been a week since we played and we said we'd go back for another play to see if we like it any better, but I'm not sure I want to. It was such a grind to organize and get setup, then the game itself didn't seem that great.

Are we crazy to not give this game another chance? Is the Marvel version significantly better and maybe we just bought the wrong version? I'd love to hear from other people that like and dislike the Alien version.",,24,,4,,public

boardgames,Classic kids games with twists to make them fun for drunk adults,False,3,0,"Hi everyone,

I'm planning a party for my 30th in a couple of months and have taken inspiration from No Rolls Barred's EXCELLENT House Rules series where they play classic kids/family games with a twist to make them more ridiculous or entertaining for adults. I'd like to have a whole suite of these available for people to play at the party and wondered if anyone has any ideas I could use to flesh out the selection?

So far, mostly ripped shamelessly from House Rules, I've got:

Handcuff Twister:
Twister played in teams of two (plus a third to spin the dial). Players are handcuffed together. If one player's handcuffed hand comes up on the dial, the other player's handcuffed hand is freed from its previous position. 

Guess Who with Vibes Only:
Guess who, but you can't ask anything to do with their physical appearance. E. G. 'is their dad proud of them?' 'have they had a threesome?' 

Operation Blindfold:
Operation in teams of two. One player is blindfolded and their teammate has to guide them to the right spot with their voice. Constant sudden death rules. 

Giant Jenga with boxing/other incapacitating gloves

Any ideas for other games? I've steered away from House Rules' video of Battleships where you take a shot every turn as I'd rather have games with rules twists which are more fun after a few drinks rather than being drinking games in and of themselves. 

Other game inspirations I have are below, but haven't got a suitable rules twist for any of them yet:

boardgames,Dixit Rules Question,False,12,0,"I've owned Dixit for years now and have never faced this situation until a few weeks ago.

My wife and two friends and I were playing a 4 player game of the ""race to 30 points"" Dixit edition. My wife had 29 points. I had 28 points. The other two players were no where near 30 points.

On the last turn of the game, my wife was the active player. She gave a clue that referenced a topic I was familiar with, and I was pretty sure the other two players were not.

Given that I was likely the only person who could both provide a decent red herring and deduce which card was hers, I gambled and made the decision to intentionally vote for a card that *wasn't* hers. 

It paid off. The other two players missed her clue and picked each other's cards, and I also picked one of theirs. Since no one picked the correct card, everyone but my wife received 2 points and I won the game.

Besides my questionable decision to anger my wife, I'm not sure if I did anything wrong. The rules *do* state that ""the goal of the players is to find the active player's card"" and to ""vote in secret for the card he/she thinks is the active player's."" 

But in the above situation, this conflicts with the overall goal of the game — to reach 30 points. It's also an unenforceable rule (maybe I *did* think that was her card after all). Should I knowingly lose the overall game by choosing correctly, or is it okay to be incorrect to win the overall game?

I'm sure many will say that this is way too complicated and gamey for a game like Dixit. And you're absolutely right. But my wife and I are competitive people, so I'd still love to know what other people think!",,17,,12,,public

I have never won it yet, but this time I was determined and prepared well. I played for the Greyjoys, and my friend Tom played for the Starks. He offered me an alliance in the hope of farming castles, ports and gaming machines for himself. But around the middle of the game, it became profitable for me to screw him and team up with Tyrell.

What makes it bad?",False,4,0,"I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/tfpspz/do_you_watch_kickstarter_videos/) on ""Do you watch Kickstarter videos?"" and was surprised to learn that many people (at least the ones who commented) do not watch them or rely on them.

The way I see it, these videos need to get the viewer intrigued fast enough so that they will keep on watching, and then give enough relevant information so that the viewer will think ""hmmm, this is cool! I want to learn more! (or even buy this!)"".

So for those of you who do watch these videos, what makes them good in your opinion and get you intrigued and wanting to learn more? And what makes them bad and puts you off?",,25,,4,,public
boardgames,Question About Tiny Epic Dungeons Bosses:,False,3,0,"Just bought Tiny Epic Dungeons and am reading the PDF for the third time before it arrives to internalize the rules. Whats bugging me out is the following:
-When the boss is outside the boss lair, can you still fight it? If so, do you need to be on the boss mat or just can it just be fought in dungeon? If its the former, do you need to enter through the boss lair card or do you just move from the room you share with he boss onto the boss mat?(basically treating the room as a pseudo-boss lair).

boardgames,"Thinking about investing in Twilight Imperium, but am a bit intimidated. Need advice.",False,14,0,"I've been heavily involved in the boardgame hobby for about 10 years now, and own around 70 games (of which I play about 20 on a fairly regular basis).  Currently my wife and I are about 20% done with Crimson Scales, and loving it immensely.

I've always avoided Twilight Imperium because of the sheer weight of the game (both physically and mentally) and the cost (both financially and time-wise).  But recently I've been drawn to it for various reasons, and after watching about 6 videos on 'how to' as well as playthrough, I am really considering it.  However, I have some questions and concerns:

1. how steep is the learning curve?  Do you have it mostly figured out after playing an hour or two, or do you need to play it through a few times before you really know what you're doing?
2. if I've played the game myself a few times, and want to introduce it to a friend, is there any chance a newbie can win when playing their first game, or would it be no contest (this is obviously related to question 1 above)
3. will serious, strategic gamers always prevail over casual players?  In other words, can someone just play for fun and still compete based on (perhaps) some luck, or does a few mistakes sort of steamroll into a losing campaign?  Can you catch up if way behind?
4. can you pretty much tell who is NOT going to win after 3 hours?  If you play a 4-player game, and you come in last place, did you know you were certain to lose for several hours, or did you have realistic hope all the way until the end (maybe the last 30 minutes) that you had a chance?
5. If 4 people are all newbies, playing for the 1st time, would it make sense to play the game for an hour or two, and then start over (everything new) for a better understood experience?  If I get the game and share it with friends, we'll all be noobs, and I think knowing what you're doing is more fun than guessing.

Any other advice would be appreciated.  Thanks!

boardgames,How good is Dice Throne actually?,False,0,0,"I bought all 3 copies of dice throne recently (rerolled s1, s2 and marvel, no adventures as it’s not available in uk atm). Just standard not Kickstarter editions.

I also bought the sleeves, which in total was quite expensive, takes up a lot of shelf space and was an impulse purchase by me. I’ve given it a go and after 3 play sessions I have mixed feelings about this game.

I feel that the game is a lot more complex than I thought it would be. Rerolling for the right dice is actually non-trivial as what is ‘optimal’ is not immediately obvious. 

The roll mechanic is exactly like king of Tokyo but far more complex in what you should reroll. To learn each hero is also quite difficult I found, and the game doesn’t scale that well beyond 1v1. It suffers from similar issues to MTG and Yugioh when you try and add more players. Not necessarily a flaw, just an observation. 

I feel torn - was my purchase a bad decision? I feel to play just the marvel set of 8 heroes will take a long time. Why on earth did I buy 24 characters? I like the idea of picking up a deck and just playing, and that’s why I bought a lot of MTG anthologies so we can pick a random deck and see how we do. The more prepared player doesn’t necessarily win as the decks are fixed and (relatively) balanced.

I expected it to be like MTG. However, given the complexity of the characters it’s not actually pick up and play. It’s more like pick up, learn for 20 minutes and then play. Assuming that is… you want to be somewhat optimal with your rerolls.

Am I needlessly complaining about an otherwise great game? I think I have buyers regrets atm and trying to justify that I’ve just spent £500 ~ $575 on a lemon of a game. The ratings are very high on BGG and I expected more. Perhaps it’s because I need to give it more time. We had way more fun mashing out roll player / king of Tokyo / MTG / yugioh than we did with dice throne. 

Thoughts? :(

EDIT: Thanks for all the comments everyone. Just to clarify I did watch a couple of review videos before buying, I didn’t buy them without any homework! I watched some videos and also bass on BGG scores I thought it would be a great experience since I love card games in general. 

What surprised is that (for now) I would probably rate the game a 7 based on my play experience, and I just expected a bit more. I knew it was a Yahtzee experience going in similar to king of Tokyo because the roll mechanics are almost identical. It is very different to MTG, I was sort of hoping for a pick up and play experience that was better. It might be better for some but to me it’s not clear that it is. I think I was just expecting more because it was so highly ranked. Dice throne for me at the moment feels like a fairly average board game.",,35,,0,,public

My wife flooded the bathroom last night and it started leaking through the floor directly onto our boardgame shelf in the basement. Luckily she heard it and only 3 or 4 copies of Patchwork on the top shelf got major damage. (Ok that part was a joke).

But seriously, I just happened to have a crappy Walmart Guess Who knockoff along with a couple of games still in shrinkwrap on the top shelf and they maganed to shield most of the games below from the worst of it. We were able to get everything moved away and toweled off quickly so only 3 or 4 boxes got some water stains. I don't think anything inside was damaged from the look of it.

Aaaaanyway, that corner of the house is really the only space we can reasonably fit these games, but we are worried about flooding again.

boardgames,Suburbia Questions,False,8,0,"Busted out suburbia collectors edition and taught a group of friends who've never played it before. I'm not quite sure how to word what happened but here we go. Also, to preface, because it was a learning game we didn't use the secret objectives, and I think the last place player was something like 45 rep, and first place was like 67

One friend thought that water purification plant was incredibly broken and swingy. He said it gives the first person to buy it such an incredibly leap that nobody else can possibly catch up. Also fwiw, that tile showed up 3 times in the 4p game. He felt like this game, or at least this experience, makes it to be one of those games where if you have a bad early game, you spend the rest of the game watching everyone else win (my experience with catan and new players).

Another friend interpreted the rules for the tiles as saying that you have to pay $2 for every industrial tile you have every single turn, which is the trade off for how cheap it is vs how much of a reputation buff it gives you. I told him that given that the mix of tiles we got wasn't very industrial heavy, it was a fairly powerful card for this game, but if someone was banking on making an industrial focused set up, it would punish them pretty hard. He didn't really think that to be the case and strongly believe it punishes you every turn, and that every turn you...reset everything and recalculate everything, which sounds off because the board keeps up with this for you, but I couldn't find a rule that expressly says things only happen once.

Being that we were using the collectors edition, I get the impression that mixing all the tiles up kind of detracts from the experience. Like we had some of the halloween/moon symbol tiles that played off other tiles with the same symbol, but for awhile we never saw any other tiles with that symbol. They didn start showing up in the C stack, but yeah. First time I played the game was with the basic core set, this is first time I used any expansions.

boardgames,Six New Games!!,False,31,0,"Yesterday, our box arrived here in Zimbabwe, from the UK, with six new games in it (https://youtube.com/shorts/qXtRORX-LIg?feature=share)

We picked up:

• Skulls of Sedlec

• Sprawlopolis

• Skull King

• Kariba

• Regicide (played with standard decks before but I love the art)

• Tiny Epic Kingdoms


So far:

Skulls of Sedlec is awesome. My wife is a big ""skull"" fan. Slap a skull on it and she wants it. We played five rounds yesterday at 2 and 3 player, and I'm in love. It's one of those games where the limitations (one action, two card hand size) are frustrating in a good way. Easy to play, rules are easy to memorize due to the theme, and I love the art.

I've played three solo games of Sprawlopolis, won one, lost two. Delightfully thinky, works well as solo and I'm keen to try multiplayer. Astonished at how small this game is but how big it feels. Worried it might ""grow old"" when I've seen all the objectives, but I guess there are then a tonne of expansions 😅

Skull King. Not played yet, but it sounds amazing and everyone I know who's played it races about it. As my wife is to skulls, I am to pirates. Put a pirate on the box and I'm in. Rulebook suggests leaving mermaids in, but reviews all talk of the ""base game"" being without them? Also seems like there's a TONNE of scope for different modes, etc. Keen to try this at the weekend with the crew.

The second I saw Kariba, I knew I had to get it. Lake Kariba is in Zimbabwe, and I love several of Reiner Knizia's other games (including Loot, of course). Seems weird to name a waterhole game about a lake, but I guess ""Hwange"" (whilst Zimbabwean and technically more fitting) doesn't have the same ring to it. Box is smaller than I anticipated (which is cool) and the game sounds easy fun. Looking forward to teaching our live-in niece and nephew!

Not much to say about Regicide. I love the game in general, have only played solo before. The art on the ""official"" deck is just gorgeous and I think will help remind players of what the different suits do. Of course, we COULD use it for standard card games, but I think a round of Egyptian Rat Screw might just wreck the deck, so I'll stick to a standard Bicycle deck for that, haha! 

Tiny Epic Kingdoms surprised me actually. We've played a LOT of Galaxies, Dinosaurs, Zombies, Pirates, and Dungeons, and I was surprised at how slim Kingdoms is (no stacks of cards?) I've only played a single 1v1 against my wife, so far, but I really enjoyed the pace, the versatility of the races, and how quick the game plays. We didn't use the Exploration mini-expansion in our first game, which I think we will use in our first group game this weekend. My only quibble is that war seems really... Obvious? I like that there's no RNG, but I can easily read my opponents race cards and see if war is worth it. I guess the point is to sometimes throw a meeple at them just to get them to burn resources as you immediately surrender? Intrigued to play more of this.

Have you played any of these? Do you enjoy them? Would love to hear your thoughts too!",,10,,31,,public
boardgames,Playing Boardgames with my Parents,False,0,0,"    I just wanted to share my experience playing boardgames and wanted to hear what people thought about it.

    I’m 16m and have been playing boardgames with my parents ever since I got into Candyland as a kid. Since then the boardgames have increased in difficulty and that leads to what I wanted to share.

    I don’t know exactly when it started, but probably around the time I was able to buy my first boardgame of my own  (can’t remember which one currently) the tables turned on me. 

    It was now up to me to learn the new boardgames we wanted to play and to set them up. This was fine by me because I love learning about new games and am a bit of a neat freak so setting up things exactly how I wanted was fine by me. 

    Then we got Puerto Rico. Don’t get me wrong I love Puerto Rico, but I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a pain to set up. There were so many things to set up after a couple plays I’ve started to dread even playing the game. I can’t help but think how faster it would be to set up if I had some help…

    The other problem with Puerto Rico is that it probably is one of the most complex games we play. Since I was the one who read the rule book it was up to me to explain everything, and when I got something wrong I was blamed for it. They accused me of modifying the rules to ensure I won, and I am a competitive person, but cheating doesn’t bring me any joy.

    That experience also made me think that if one of them decided to read the rules as well we could have double checked things to make sure we were playing the game correctly. As well as if they understood the game as well as I did maybe they wouldn’t have to ask as many times for rule clarifications which distract me and increases the playtime of every game we play. To make things worse I keep track of how many wins we all have (I understand that this is a bad idea, but I need to know), and I am I’m last which bothers me a little bit lol since I’m the reason we can play it at all.

To sum it all up, some of the boardgames we are getting into require elaborate setup and complex rules (at least for us) and I don’t want to shoulder that responsibility alone.

Now, since the highest face on a given die is a 2, that means it’s impossible for the haunt to begin until there are at least three omens revealed.

boardgames,War of the ring rules explanation,False,5,0,"Hey I was playing and had several questions to clarify.  
When playing free people, when you take damage from a battle, can you demote an elite if you have no regulars left or can you take a regular from the “dead” pile or does it take it from the fresh recruits. 

Also with Nazgûl’s can you recruit them with a muster die and if so, and Nazgûl’s get killed, can you revive them and spawn them again. 

My other question would be when attacking a stronghold that hasn’t had people hiding yet for instance my friend had 8 regular/elite units on minas tirith, does this attack only allow hits on 6 still or do the free people get punished for having a fight outside their stronghold and get hit by 5’s. 

Also if a fight happens outside the stronghold, can the party inside the stronghold fight the army on top of them or are they not allowed to move at all until a shadow army is not on top of them. 

For the hunt, let’s say I have 3 eyes in the eyes hunt before the fellowship move. The player moves the fellowship now for the first time. Do I immediately roll for those 3 die and only hit on 6’s and roll again if he has moved again on this turn rotation and now I hit on 5’s and if he moves again I roll and draw on if I hit at least one four.

The intrigue and political play of Game of Thrones always astonished me. However, I never found a game that had that level of player interaction and the possibility of building alliances and complex social networks. After reading hundreds of game rules, I discovered there was no game out there like that. I started searching for mechanics that could allow for such a game, but I found none! Cosmic Encounter is perhaps the best alliance-building, simple but complex board game (which has one of the most play counts in my group) but it is still far from the experience I was looking for. So, I started to explore designing a game with these elements and, after many trials and errors, ended up with Elven Throne. Gameplay summarized below:

* Simple Rules - Focus on your own strategy instead of being overwhelmed by complicated rules
* Alliances – Supports cooperation and competition with a twist on win conditions
* Extremely Interactive – Interactive mechanics allow players to always be active, even on other players' turns
* A Chess-like Sensation of a Surprise Master Plan  (i.e., no hidden information)
   *  Many games allow surprising moves by hiding information. This is easy to do, but hidden information also cripples the possibility of players reacting to and reading into each others' plans (which is a big part of the game, say, reading each other’s minds!). Elven Throne allows this to happen without hiding information itself, in the same way that it is hard to predict a chess player's move even though nothing is hidden from either player
* House Specific Powers with Diverse Playing Styles",,24,,23,,public
boardgames,[Vast: the Crystal Caverns] Goblin's 'Trap' secret interaction with the Knight's attack,False,13,0,"I don't understand how the Goblin's 'Trap' secret works when the Knight attacks the Goblin. As far as I understand, the Knight gets to *enter* a tribe's square when her Strength is **greater than** the tribe's Strength. *Afterwards* they have to use an encounter to attack the tribe, causing them to scatter.

But as far as I can figure out, there is no further mention of Strength being used during the attack. So the Strength of a tribe only appears to matter in barring the Knight from entering the square.

However, now my Knight with 3 Strength enters a square with a 2 Strength tribe. I proceed to attack that tribe. My opponent points to their Trap secret and mentions that their Strength increases during the attack and is now also at 3… but for what purpose?

Does my Knight now lose the attack? Does the tribe still scatter? Should my Knight have been able to enter the square at all?

What is the correct interaction with the 'Trap' secret?

**Update:**

After asking [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/brunoscheele/status/1572607853655130113), Leder Games' social came back with the [following answer on another forum](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1658280/article/24011805#24011805);

&gt;You play it face up in front of you during your turn.  
The Knight can only enter the space if the attack would succeed, so the one extra strength makes it harder for the Knight to attack.  
If it is discarded to block a Dragon attack the attack doesn't do anything.

Played it 3 times now and there's always great moments and lot of fun, thought I'd share to see what can be improved or maybe someone will give it a try!

A bit of background: 4 of us are absolute veterans in wargaming strategy and roleplay, the rest are newcomers to the hobby (siblings, significant others, etc) and in ankh we've seen the opportunity to satisfy both longtime players and fresh new minds, here's our homebrew ruleset. We have no problem with long games, this usually takes 4 to 5 hrs tops. 

You NEED the pantheon expansion for this to work.
We also have the guardians, haven't gotten around to test it with pharaoh.

Say there's 9 players

Basically it is a 5 players scenario BUT absolutely ALL players start the game syncretized (merged) and there is no merger (we play the scenario that has no merge)
. During the turn, you play one action per player. In case you have no ""partner"" (the 9th player) you take your normal (two actions) turn BUT you still are syncretized as if you have two gods. No one may repeat turn actions at any point in the game. Each ""team"" has to decide and battle conjoined, so we seat each other so that team turns are one after the other. For the ankh powers it's merged god rules, the have to share each power that they unlock.

The other special rule is that you can only use your god power in the regions where the figure of your god is, not in the whole field. The difference is that now we play with the TWO figures of the each god a ""team"" controls, and those figures determine which are the valid regions to make the power.This alters certain god's powers, for example Osiris may now only place a maximum of two gates of the underworld, or Bastet only two cat tokens (we take the +2 out) The rest of the game is the same as normal. 5 warriors maximum (since the extra god figure is the 6th), usual number of guardians as well.

boardgames,Any good house rules for getting a complete Gloomhaven experience?,False,1,0,"So I played Gloomhaven on TTS during the pandemic with friends. My group and I met every Sunday evening to play through a scenario; after a about 4 or 5 it became clear that it would take multiple playthroughs for us to experience everything the game has to offer, all of the characters, items, side quests etc.

Whilst we really enjoyed the experience, realistically none of us were ever going to play it through from beginning to end again, at least for the foreseeable future, which made me regret not being able to try all the classes and unlocks. One of the house rules we implemented to at least try and boost our party was that we would be allowed to claim all coins and treasure chests on a map if at the end of the scenario no monsters were still in play; even still, we did not get to experience everything the game had to offer. 

With Frosthaven now due in a couple of months I’m wondering what house rules or changes people would recommend to get the most out of it (assuming somewhat similar progression and unlock mechanics)? This is assuming that you get just a single playthrough with a dedicated 4 person group that can only get together, at best, once a month now.",,20,,1,glory-to-rome,public

boardgames,Finally got a dedicated board game shelf!,False,88,0,"And I'm darn sure proud of it! I've been involved with the hobby since early 2019, starting slowly, and building up to now. First game was Twilight Imperium 4ed, and that didnt got so well, lol. After that, I got Scythe, which we used to play 2-3 times an evening. It is probably still my single most played game, not counting Gloomhaven.  I just love discovering new, unique worlds board games can bring into my home - and I'd dare say I'd give any oddity and a weird game a fair chance and try.

Wouldnt change much really - I heard all the horror stories of game collections reaching eldritch proportions that refuse to be tamed, but then again, I'd sure love more games, but I'd also love to somehow get the time needed to play them. And i hate reaching for the rulebook, and teaching has been getting tiresome lately. I still kinda miss the feeling we had while Scythe was more or less the only game - everyone knew the rules perfectly, no consulting the rulebook, games are fast, and so on. Lately tho, I fell out of love with Scythe - while I still love its more or less unique ""cold war"" gameplay, where the threat of combat is probably all you are gonna see until the very late game, and its presentation and table presence are amazing - I sorta grew disillusioned with it over its game balance. Invaders from Afar, while being quite fun to play, feel a hell lot weaker than base game factions, and certain combinations are just plain bad. Sadly, Scythe isnt much like say Root, where the shaky balance can be self-regulated by the gameplay itself, due to its focus on the threat of combat instead of combat itself. I'm also sorta collectionist - I insist on having every single expansion, promo or module, which can cause a slight headache from time to time.

Still have lots of empty space tho, and i just love discovering new, unique games. Any suggestions with what to fill it? I've been thinking of getting some lighter games, namely Cosmic Frog which I just cant find anywhere, and perhaps Brian Boru, which seems to be quite fast, light and yet deep and replayable.

boardgames,So I played Dominion for the first time last weekend at my brothers house and I’m in love,False,24,0,"I’m actually a fairly avid board game player (though maybe not compared to a lot of you), so I’m not sure how I’ve managed to miss this game for basically 15 years.  Anyway, my reason for posting is that I want to buy Dominion, but seeing how many versions and expansions there are, I want to make an informed purchase. So now I will provide some context to help you all give me the best possible advice.

I have 3 kids that I play board games with semi-frequently (though not as much as we’d all like), ages 12, 10, and 6.  The 2 older ones are definitely ahead for their ages, and greatly enjoy playing Catan, 7 Wonders, Civ IV A New Dawn (these first 3 are my favorites), Pandemic, Munchkin, many of the Forbidden Island games, Risk, and Stratego.  My 6 year olds favorite games probably shouldn’t factor in, as that will likely change a lot over the next few years.  My wife’s favorite games are social games like Beyond Balderdash, but she also quite likes 7 Wonders and Acquire (high on my list as well).  As a family, we enjoy 5 minute dungeon because the team aspect and it includes the 6 year old.

I also play with a range of adults maybe every other month or so, who would likely enjoy Dominion quite a bit. 

As for cost, perhaps I could justify up to $100, but surely we can spend less than that and get plenty of hours of enjoyment.",,30,,24,,public

boardgames,Opinions on AuZtralia,False,20,0,"I’d been interested in [AuZtralia by Martin Wallace](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/231581/auztralia) since it appeared on the shelves a little while ago, and recently picked up a copy when I saw it on sale.

For those who don’t know, British designer Wallace is very prolific and his many games include Brass, DiscWorld, Steam, London, Via Nebula and A Study in Emerald, and I like some of them but dislike others.

For examples, the rarely-seen or mentioned [Via Nebula](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191231/nebula) has a fascinating blend of map exploration and shared incentives, whereas the otherwise very popular [Brass](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28720/brass-lancashire) seems vastly over-complicated to me. 

A few games in to AuZtralia I’m impressed that the unlikely blend of Lovecraftian horror and early 20th Century Australia doesn’t at all seem forced\*), and his use of Time as an action cost is engaging, adds tension, and is highly thematic. (Time is running out before the Old Ones awaken and rampage across the lands).

For example, towards the end of the game you can spend more Time to build a stronger military force, but might run out of Time (and time) to actually get them in to combat.

Then whilst the rules aren’t difficult to learn, they are complicated (having many parts); the combat and moves for the Old Ones (essentially an automata) are absurdly fiddly, and all the games seem to take twice as long as they ought to.

I haven’t tried a 2-player or solitaire game yet, and suspect the 2-player will need players to start close to one another, and that the game might actually be *better* as a solitaire than with 4 players! 

So it’s a curious game, and I wondered if others with experience of it have any remarks about the way the game develops for players after multiple games, or comments about Wallace’s designs with respect to his other games perhaps?

I'm not springing Gloomhaven, Spirit Island, or anything remotely like that on them.

boardgames,Games with “texty” Cards/Tokens,False,4,0,"Over the years, I’ve realized that I tend not to prefer games with dozens of unique “texty” cards ie: cards with loads of text describing Actions or Events or some other game outcome. 


eg: a card called “**Iron Shepard**” that lets you Take 2 coins for every sheep on your board. Exception: if any other player has a *black* sheep, then this card has no effect. Compensate that player with 2 sausages unless they *also* hold the **Jade Grill** card in which case, give them 3 sausages and set **Threat Level** to ***obsidian***. 


It feels like these cards/games have drawn a lot of inspiration from Magic The Gathering (something which I personally never got into) and maybe that’s the appeal? I acknowledge that having such cards makes a game vastly replayable (“ah, I didn’t see this Hatchet card on my last play, but here it is now. Time to kill some sheep!!”) but I find that they make games so random and inelegant that I just can’t get into it. 

To cite specific examples: I enjoy Marvel United where the cards are just combinations of 3 symbols (with only a few “texty” cards) but I don’t enjoy Marvel Champions with its 100 unique texty cards.

boardgames,Gaming Living Room [COMC],False,164,0,"Hi all,

My wife and I are finally ready to show off our Gaming Living Room and our collection.

First; the pictures!

https://preview.redd.it/ogofxoesgxo91.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5376b92fb70aa7b81cae8e9dba6c115e0b880011

https://imgur.com/a/YdhmGlP

&amp;#x200B;

I've been board/analog gaming for a majority of my life, but it was mostly Monopoly and Pinochle with my family, and then some Magic: the Gathering and various other CCG's in the 90s. I didn't really get introduced into modern board gaming until the mid '00's when my best friend started having us play board games over lunch. Stone Age, to Agricola, to Power Grid... a bunch of classics of that time period.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really have need to buy anything at that time, because my best friend was a massive collector and did all the buying for us! Except... he moved away eventually. Then it turned into a yearly 'retreat' where a bunch of us, instead of going to GenCon to play games, would just go to one of our houses and play games. We rotate the hosting duties every year, and have about 4 different homes that we go to. We tend to fly in Wed-Sun once a year, only skipping 2020 for obvious reasons. We've done this now for over a decade. For years, this was mostly how/when I analog gamed - spending a bunch of my gaming time in video games. Occasionally I'd get a game out with a friend here or there, as it was more than a passing interest of mine given the yearly sojourn.

&amp;#x200B;

Then in 2019, I picked up Legendary Marvel on a lark with my wife at the FLGS, and she showed more than a passing interest in it. We then proceeded to play the every lovin' crap out of it through '19. Given that I might have a board gaming partner at home, maybe we should go to the FLGS a bit more!

&amp;#x200B;

Which led us to picking up Pandemic Legacy in Jan '20 (the timing? right?). My wife and I proceeded to play through for the next few months, deciding to ironically finish the last two months once the pandemic hit. The pandemic hitting was also reason enough for me to pick up Gloomhaven and my wife and I destroyed that game in lockdown and that was the beginning of me officially becoming a collector.

So from a collection standpoint, this really started in 2020, and while that might not be super interesting to some... there's some random old games in my closet of shame, and really the super star here is the dedication to craft that we've pursued here in the custom work we've had done to celebrate and show off our hobby.

&amp;#x200B;

What would I change about my collection? I really initially bought for game types to make sure that I had choices for every group/option/play style. I would pass up some games if I already had a game of that type (although not always...). Really the biggest change needed is that I'm so much in the cult of the new and the kickstarter cycle that I'm sure there are games I would absolutely enjoy that are already out there and I just have missed the news/review/bgg cycle on them. I am a big table presence guy though, as I don't have a good mind's eye, and having mini's is actually really important to me (I was also a fairly big Warhammer Fantasy Table Top gamer with my best friend in the '00's, so I'm kind of used to that play experience).

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately though, this as become an amazing hobby in which all three of my boys have joined in. Sometime after we stopped campaign gaming, we brought in our boys slowly but surely (14, 12, and almost 9 now... we started two years ago). Ramping them up with complexity and really planning our weekends around what game we were going to play. We've even gone so far as to have played TI4 seven times as a family of 5. We tend to make it an Event Game and buying ""space food"" and just playing up the event more than the overall competitiveness. My eldest tends to compete hard with my wife and I, but the younger two are balls of chaos that cannot be ignored. The middle child is also deviously intelligent in some games now, and we cannot under estimate him.

So for that, I'm thankful. We have an adult couple that comes over once or twice a month, and we tend to get 2-5 games in a weekend (depending on the length of game).

&amp;#x200B;

Top Game:

**Cloudspire** \- This game doesn't get enough love and attention, and I know why. It's got a weird elevator pitch, and a difficult learning curve. But for head to head PvP, it's an amazing game and my wife and I wish we could get it to the table more. Unfortunately, we aren't really a fan of it at 3p or 4p counts, and my middle child LOVES it, so it's hard to play at anything other than 3 or 4p.. so we tend not to get it out as much as we want. However, if you are looking for a deeply strategic PvP game that has assymetrical factions with some progression mechanics... it doesn't get much better than this. And  honestly, most people love Cloudspire for the solo puzzle play. It feels like I'm a rare one that loves the PvP mode here more.

Game that gets played the most (and is probably #2):

**Ankh: Gods of Egypt** \- We just had our 13th play of this game this weekend as a family. It just works at all player counts, and not only works, is REALLY GOOD at all player counts. Yes, the merge mechanic is controversial, and yes merging with the almost 9 year old can put you in a bind... but the decision space is so wonderful. Also; we were lucky to play with the expansion on play 1, and I think that's mandatory. So anyone who reads any review on this game/plays this game w/o the expansion needs to throw it away. The priest/politic card mechanic opens up a very necessary avenue of play with the possibilities of 'take that' from the cards you pick up, not to mention the layers of depth provided by moving the Pharaoh around, or providing yet another reason to trigger/not trigger the control monuments event.

&amp;#x200B;

The one game type that we've definitely dove heavy into is Heavy Euros for sure. My wife and I really enjoy games above 3.5 weighting in BGG, even if it sometimes frustrates us during the learning curve of the game. **Barrage** was a big surprise for me, as we had picked that up even before the BGA adaptation and probably has been my biggest mover up my favorite list chart. I haven't taken the time to make a top 10 list recently, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't in there at this point, after initially not being super high (the power mechanics are a bit obtuse at first).

&amp;#x200B;

**Black Rose Wars** is our favorite family game that isn't a ""good"" game. The English translation is very flawed, and we have to do a bit of game design on the fly sometimes, but we always have a great time slinging spells and having traps bounce off protection spells, while summoning big beasts... it's just a blast for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Favorite game that you've never heard of: **Daimyo: Rebirth of an Empire**. I enjoy Japanese/Chinese culture/myths and so this was a low expectation early kickstarter pickup. It's kind of kitchen sink mechanics game like Lost Ruins of Arnak (some deck building, some set collection, some area control) with some Scythe like player board revealing. It's a silly theme and doesn't make it to the table often (there are better games for sure), but it's always a good time when it comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh right, the cabinets :) It was 18 months from contacting our first contractor until we got it fully installed. The first contractor sat on our deposit and did nothing for 9 months (I think he under bid us, and the wood+labor was going to be too much and just... wasn't professional enough to do anything but keep us hanging). When we finally switched to a new contractor, it took them about 6 months to get through their queue and build it. It was a 2.5 day install to get everything up once they did finally get to that point.

We wanted an art piece, and not just a bunch of Kallaxes, mostly because we decided that we were going to repurpose our family room as our gaming room. It's literally the first thing you see when you come into the house (unless you are family, which means you come through the garage, naturally). With the big picture window, we didn't want to eliminate any sight lines to our back yard (and the mountains you can see) from our dining room (off camera left) so we always wanted curves into the window and not straight lines. Which lead to the original concept.

The lighting and the wiring was big challenge for me, I've used WLED strips and Home Automation for a few years now, but this was going to be my biggest project yet, and I had done a lot of reading.. but converting that into something real was a big trial and error. There are over 2300 LEDs in the cabinet, with three different power supplies. I've learned a lot, and I'm still learning how to harden it and make it safer and more permanent. I've still got some jury rigged portions ;)

Anyways, thanks for reading!

boardgames,"Etiquette questions (three of them), opinions wanted.",False,67,0,"1. So a couple months ago I was trying to teach some family members a relatively easy game as games go (splendor) and I found it pretty challenging to keep them engaged during just the rules portion of the explanation. They repeatedly said things like ""there are soo many rules"" and ""holy crap this is complicated"". This then lead to distracted side conversations about other things, laughing at my difficulty with further breaking down the rules, and the game taking forever to get started. Anybody else had this happen? What did you to about it?

2. Somebody quits out of a game entirely; this particular instance was a bad timing issue. But another person I know occasionally seems to disengage with the game and visibly lose interest, putting less effort into their turns. This brings the whole vibe down and I feel it's super lame. Had this happen? How'd you handle it?

3. Why do people whip out their phones in between every single turn? Even for just a few seconds of scrolling. Then they inevitably are reminded that it's their turn and have to then think about what to do and hold up the flow of the game, leading to more phones coming out. Am I just an old codger in the making or is as annoying as I feel it is?

Apologies if this seems like a complaining post. Just looking for whatever input you can offer. Thanks!

EDIT: I recognize that splendor is not necessarily ""easy"". I do feel though that it's much more approachable that games like scythe or ankh to the non gamer or noob.",,93,,67,,public

boardgames,"Board Game Table with ""End Turn"" Buttons",False,25,0,"Over the past 2 years of COVID lockdowns my friends and I started playing our board games online via Table Top Simulator.

This meant that no matter how distracted any player became we always knew whose turn it was.

Now that the world has (hopefully) returned to normal(ish) and we've returned to playing games in person, I've realized just how much I miss this feature of TTS. So, I built a real world equivalent using a custom built table, some arcade buttons, and a bunch of software.

boardgames,Has Agricola been surpassed yet for WP?,False,44,0,"I count myself amongst the many who would credit Agricola as THE origin of their love fest with this hobby. It was my introduction to worker placement. I started with the family side of the board, and eventually worked my way up to the occupations and improvements. I love everything this game has to offer, especially the feeding and need to diversify.

As a life-long learner, and find it hard to believe I have yet to encounter a game that does WP better than a game from 2008. Not for lack of trying though. I gave Viticulture a go, but found the visitor cards not only swingy, but the best strategy for winning. Barrage has come very close, but the WP aspect isn't as central to the game as Agricola's. Uwe's other designs such as Feast for Odin, Caverna, and Fields of Arle don't have the same bite and tension that Agricola has.

boardgames,European enthusiasts and people from all over the world have recreated incredible and iconic board games set in The Lord of the Rings universe,False,0,0,"How well do you remember J. Tolkien's legendary “Lord of the Rings” franchise? True LOTR fans have created many exciting board games that will immerse you in this legendarium. Let's take a look at the most memorable and unique of its kind.

Let's talk about the first project – The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth. The beloved franchise returns and gives again those unforgettable emotions received after watching a movie or reading a book. This project is a board game that can be played live. The main innovative feature of this board game, which amazes loads of people and fans, is a special application with which the gameplay itself takes place.

Players can choose from six famous characters in the book: Aragorn, Legolas, Beravor, Bilbo, Helena, or Gimli. The first “Bones of Arnor” campaign consists of 14 different scenarios. The choice of the player and the cards for the mission determines who their character will be.

At the start of the game, players receive starter equipment and skill cards. Then they will find new items and learn different skills. Occasionally, you have to go through various tests, the result of the success of which will be displayed on the map.

The main distinguishing feature is the display of everything that happens on the table in the form of a map, which is collected in parts as the plot develops. 

The second project that is worth a lot of attention is - The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Ring. This 3D board game is tightly connected with the plot of the book. This game will appeal not only to the true fans of the franchise, but also to fans of various strategies. The venue of the game is a huge map of Middle-earth, made in the canonical style. The essence of the game lies in the plot advancement of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee to the well-known Mount Doom in order to destroy Sauron and the troops of darkness. 

The parties here, of course, are divided into Light and Darkness. The process of this game in the case of playing as Darkness consists in the capture of various territories, such as fortresses or large cities, by the armies and generals of darkness, in order to score the required number of points for the victory of Sauron. Light players have many actions such as: event cards, characters, armies, companion, items that will lead to the destruction of the ring of Omnipotence and the victory of the inhabitants of Middle-earth. 

This game has also great expansions: Warriors of Middle-earth, Lords of Middle-earth, Blood of Gondor. They add loads of characters to the game and also replace them. There also new scripts included. 

The final project is The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies. For lovers of variety or just ardent fans of the entire franchise. The development of the plot revolves around the well-known Bilbo Baggins, the forces of Light and Darkness.

The Shadow player, as in the second project, must capture settlements or strongholds in order to score victory points and then win. The Forces of Light have 3 options for victory: gain a scale of fate as you progress through the game or another condition, reaching Beorn, the last option is to kill Bolg - the leader of the orcs.

As a result, we have 3 exciting board games, each of which has certain features, such as: an interactive map, the gradual development of the plot and large-scale wars in Middle-earth. Tell your friends about this games to involve them in great adventures.

From what I know both are economic strategy games. I love the concept of Pan am for its theme and I’ve read reviews lauding it for how balanced the game is (parks felt balanced too, we played it numerous times. and we loved the theme!)

Now for 7 Wonders I’m wondering if the number of cards that change per round mean more diversity in plays. Is it much more exhilarating to play than pan am? I’ve also heard there are some plays with 7 wonders duel that the player ends up taking turns just to prevent the other from winning, I’m not too sure my parent would enjoy minding another player’s cards often apart from their own.

But, I know 7 wonders duel is a lot like a staple for two-players.

boardgames,I hate it when games hide the fact you need an expansion for higher player counts,False,7,0,"I've been looking for a fun 2v2 team based game lately, and it's been really hard to find anything at all. Finally my eye fell on Super Fantasy Brawl. It looked really fun and it was relatively inexpensive. So I was about to buy it when I noticed that it came with 6 heroes. I started looking around how the 2v2 variant is played, but it's like no one has ever bothered to share anything about playing SFB as a team game. I've been able to find a single team play video on Youtube and noticed they were playing 2 heroes per player, so that would mean that 4 player games are not supported out of the box.

There is not a single line anywhere, on any website, that indicates that this is the case. All you ever read is ""2-4 players"". This is just blatantly false advertising and I feel it happens way too often in boardgaming. I've already been burned once by Arkham LGC, where I bought a single starter set and realised that for two players to actually have fun you need to waste money on a second starter set. It feels like so many developers are out to trick you, selling starter and core sets that are barely functional and force you to search through message boards to see what else you need for a proper experience.

After the tiles are layed out, I tell my teammate a 1 word hint. My teammate now has to look at the tiles and guess as many tiles as possible that relate to my 1 word hint.

For example: let’s say these are all the words on the tiles:
-chicken
-pig
-lettuce
-cow
-milk
-cheese
-water
-cereal
-orange juice
-toothbrush

If chicken is the instakill word, I could tell my teammate “breakfast” as the 1 word hint. My teammate would then hopefully knock out pig, milk, cheese, cereal, orange juice, and toothbrush — gaining 6/10 points total. But let’s say my teammate guessed “chicken” as we’ll, we lost",,12,,14,,public

boardgames,My Dominion storage solution is broken again. I have 2 more full expansions and 3 Upgrade packs to add. What do you guys do to store them all?,False,899,0,,,138,,899,,public
boardgames,Wormholes - interstellar taxi driving,False,24,0,"I haven't really played any 'pick up and deliver' games before playing Wormholes (and I don't doubt that I'll find people who will tell that's still true after having played Wormholes). It's not been a deliberate choice - it's not like I had made a solemn vow never to engage with anything approaching logistical optimisation, but it just happened to pan out there's only two that have really piqued my interest. And, seeing the effusive praise lathered onto Wormholes by Quinten Smith of SUSD fame, I felt like I had to check this one out. 

Before I get into the gameplay, let me talk about what this game is built from. Player pieces look sleek and feel great to touch, the rulebook is nice, clear and *svelte*, and comes with more than enough pieces to do whatever your heart desires during the game. And really, this game is mercifully light on rules; it's almost Knizia-esque in that sense. It's a simple five minute teach and players are ready to fly interstellar tourists off to extraplanetary holiday destinations.

Wormholes, then, is a game where you basically play as rival interplanetary taxi drivers. Each player wants to deliver as many passengers to as many different planets as possible. However, it turns out that space is *huge* and your spaceship is *slow*. ""There has got to be a way around this!"" you scream after spending an entire turn puttering about in your tiny shuttle taxi, inching ever so slowly to your actual destination. And that's where the eponimous wormholes come in. Players will, over the course of the game, create infrastructure in the form of wormholes to massively expedite traveling between points and planets in order to more easily deliver future passengers to planets that have been previously visited. And the tunnels are public, too! Anyone can use your tunnels for the low, low price of just a single point! And honestly, how much is a point really in the grand scheme of things. 

Good wormhole usage (and therefore good wormhole building) really is the difference between a winning game and one where you're feeling kind of lost. It's the difference between same day delivery and feeling like you're stuck in the Suez channel. You want to have access to good tunnels (and a good network of them) to make sure you can actually deliver to those planets you need to hit, and to make sure that it doesn't take you forever to do so. This game really has excellent tempo built in, which is helped along by the player driven game length. 

Each time a player creates the first wormhole next to a planet, they get a reward token and shorten the length of the game just that liiiiittle bit. Once all planets have a wormhole next to them, it's three more turns and then it's done. I really like player-driven tempo as it helps prevent players just sitting around and revving up engines forever until they're just vomiting out buckets of points each turn. This also gives the game a very satisfying have arc, where you start out slow but collectively build up this infrastructure that allows you to zoom across the universe to two or sometimes even three planets by the end of the game. The systems want you to go places, and go there fast! The game is actually very good at incentivising people to go out and explore the galaxy on the table by giving people points for getting to planets first and for going to as many different planets as possible. But really, how much could a few points be? 

So we're approaching the part of the review where the negatives are now. 

With all the things the game does well, there's a few things that I can see as turn-offs for other people. For starters, yes, there is quite some randomness to the game. Wormholes uses its deck to give out objectives for you to chase for points, and you will probably encounter runs off cards that are just better. Having been forged in the fires of competitive Magic the Gathering, I don't really mind; sometimes you draw it and sometimes you don't. That said, I do feel worried about the starting card in particular. Your first delivery/deliveries will probably dictate a lot, and drawing a card that's just flatly on the other side of the universe is disheartening, even if Wormholes does have a very friendly system that allows you to basically dump your hand and draw a new one each turn. It still sucks to realize your neighbours were flying one planet over while you were being sent somewhere a million miles away. 

Then there's also the fact that poor planning or missing a good wormhole can just absolutely destroy you. I've seen it happen multiple times that someone either forgot to drop an entrance somewhere or placed something poorly, only to be forced to spend four turns puttering along while the other players were zipping across the universe raking in points. None of my games have been a blow-out because of it, but it does feel disheartening when you see your opponents breaking the laws of physics while you're on a slow boat stuck in traffic. 

On the topic of scores - I'm unsure how I feel about it. All games I've played had scores closely grouped together, which poses two issues; it disincentives players from using each other's tunnels, and it leads to games where it is impossible to properly evaluate what good play really looks like. The first of these two issues, to me, is the biggest problem that I don't really know how to fix - I'm not sure I even want to. I am however just a little sad that the end game scoring discourages people from interacting with what is arguably the coolest system in the game - the shared tunnel network! The second problem is maybe more of a me problem, but I like to see what actually impressive play looks like. If I play randomly and the other person plays an absolute blinder and we end up, like, three points apart, how do I know what lead to him having a higher score? How will I know what matters?

My last issue is related to player count. The solo mode in this game is absolutely not worth your time - it barely resembles the real game. Two players is fine, if a little 'quiet'. The game really starts to sing at three and four, and at five I think you'll have tipped over to the other side of goodness. I'm not against having a game that works best at three or four, but I would definitely stay away of you primarily intend to play it solo or 2P. While still fun as an experience, I don't think this game offers enough to people mostly playing at a low player count. 

So, with all that said, where do we land on Wormholes? I churn through games pretty aggressively (for example, I've sold and replaced about 1/3rd of my collection so far this year), but I am gladly hanging onto Wormholes. The gameplay loop and game arc feel satisfying and the game looks and feels gorgeous. It's a lovely, inviting and light game that I think will be a bit with groups of three or four looking to have a fun, zoomy and quick time together. However, I'm not really going to pull it out as a dueler and I can't imagine this turning into anyone's favourite game or even game of the year. Grab it for groups looking to have quick fun sort of working together and flying through space.",,4,,24,mage-knight,public

##FAQ

**I live in Costa Rica/Canada/Ecuador/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now I cnat spel amymor!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on two ducks and a tube of lube, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

What I enjoy about them is how adaptable they are and you can play with 1-12 relatively easily. This means it gets to hit the table all the time rather than a game like secret Hitler (which is amazing) but only gets to hit the table once every month rather than 3 times a week.

boardgames,"Wyrmwood, Kickstarter, and the Industry’s Dysfunctions",False,0,0,"This post will start with a long rant about a recent project by Wyrwood I backed leading into Kickstarter and my issues with it, with some final words on myself and the community.

I backed Wyrmwood's The Hexagonal Gaming System on Kickstarter a year ago and was very excited despite the priciness of their products. Handmade and really well presented, I thought these pieces deserve this price, and choose to buy 7 Hexagonal pieces, plus the rack and its side pieces paying a total of $330 for them (an average of $36 a piece, in case you were wondering).

Then the Pledge Manager link came, and shipping was now to be charged. All Kickstarter projects have that. You first pay the price, then pay shipping in the pledge manager. Everyone knows this, but I was still getting used to it. I had to pay an additional $37 in shipping, a bit more than their initial already high estimate of $25 to $30 for the rest of the world (I live in Germany), but still an acceptable increase within reason. Now, it's closer to 41$ a piece. Ouch! But in for a penny in for a pound. I do find the pieces very beautiful, and I do want them. I paid and remained excited. Obviously, shipping would increase the more pieces I added, so, it wasn't a lump sum of some sort, and so my average wouldn’t have been reduced had I added more pieces. But even this is a trick I wouldn’t necessarily approve of.

Then delays happened, but you know, it's a global crisis, all Kickstarter projects end up delayed apparantly, it's totally fine. Another thing that everyone knows, but I, as a relatively new comer to Kickstarter was still getting used to.

Then, a few weeks ago I finally receive notification that my shipment has finally arrived. My patience has paid off, or so I thought. With that notification, I received a message that I had to pay import fees with the amount of €78 and some cents (=$78 now that the Euro lost a lot of value). Mhmm. But why? I didn't ask for the Hexagonal Organizational System to be imported. I backed a project on Kickstarter that happens to be in a different country. Was I confused about something? When I first backed this project, I wasn't expecting to pay ~$50 a piece for 7 Hexs and their rack. I must have made a mistake. So, I sent an email to Wyrmwood asking about these additional fees only to receive this response:
""Thanks for reaching out to us. I'm very sorry for the confusion, but we do not cover any costs related to customs or import taxes.""

I thought, mhmm, I seem to have been confused. I went to their Kickstarter page to find any information on this. I must have missed it. They know they're shipping to the rest of the world and can't have missed such a big issue which would increase the total price by more than 20%. I'm sure they mentioned it somewhere on their Kickstarter page, but it was me who missed it. Alas, I could not find anything. 

They're sorry for the confusion. Only, I was not confused. I was misinformed. No-one told me I had to pay custom fees on my Kickstarter pledge. Maybe that's the norm, maybe those who back projects in other custom areas end up paying these custom fees, and I, being relatively new to Kickstarter, am only now getting used to it. 

Could I have bought theses Hexs at Essen Spiel at a much lower price? Well, I will find out in 2.5 weeks.
The pieces are indeed well made, but the bottom was filled with cork. I was paying for cork-filled wood that looks really nice, but much nicer on their page than in reality. Colours were not as beautiful in reality, and the ones that looked the most beautiful, and were thus the most expensive, turned out to be the least appealing. In Europe, if you buy something online, the law allows you a grace period of weeks to return it. On Kickstarter, I did not have that right. I barely had the right to receive the actual product I had backed. Kickstarter is not a store. Delivery dates are not guaranteed. 

But in the meanwhile, I feel that my fascination of Kickstarter came from a built-in design that is deceitful in nature. It shows you prices and gives you schedules in a way that tricks your brain. Kickstarter is selling you a promise. You're ""buying fish in the sea"" as we say in Syria (Yes, I’m a Syrian living in Germany). The fisher hasn't fished anything yet, but they're selling it to you all the same. Kickstarter, as an idea, is totally great. Back someone’s dream and get a slice of it; they’ll have their cake, and you’ll get to eat it with them, too. With regard to board games, it allows small and/or independent companies to start their own projects, and ask for our support to realise that dream, with the privilege of receiving their first copies, and even a Kickstarter bonus that only the backers will get. Only you don’t always receive the first copies, or any for some projects, and that bonus that we promised you is now on sale for the rest of the market. Kickstarter is now more of a pre-order service, with very little rights to the backers, and all the flexibility in the world for the creators. It’s a store where the customer pays upfront, then prays at the sellers alter every time they tell them that the global crisis has created more delays, thanking the seller for their update, or making an angry comment (like I did on Wyrmwood’s) to no avail.

We all know this, except it’s not written anywhere. I didn’t know two years ago, but I also didn’t do any research on it. This is a niche interest, and heavy board game consumers are the niche within the niche. I had to learn from my own mistakes, and now have many doubts if the other projects I backed on Kickstarter were even worth it. If a game ends up being the same price, or less, at my local store, in return for taking no risks, having no frustrations due to delays, and not paying any shipment, why should I “back” it in the first place? Should I stop backing games by big companies? What guarantees me a game from a first-timer company? I know I am also a hypocrite. I am a consumer disguised as a backer, but that doesn’t make Kickstarter any less guilty.
I rediscovered my love for this hobby two years ago. Then my buying craze kicked in. I now own more than 50 games and have another 30 on Kickstarter waiting to be delivered. It’s not the worst of stats, and even though I spent thousands of euros on games, I didn’t become dysfunctional, nor did I start hemorrhaging money to feed my addiction. It’s fine, but it is not great. I am now slowing down, and reducing the rate at which I buy games, while selling the ones I am not playing anymore. I now prefer buying used games to save on money, help a fellow gamer create more space in their Kalax, and reduce the pressure on the environment. I admit it, my hobby is harmful to the environment, and I do still buy games nonetheless. But that guilt is attached to any pleasure that does not use stone age technology. Here’s to hoping more companies produce more environmentally conscious games. For unlike popular believe, the Earth does not have Too Many Bones. I love the board gaming community, and I love the media surrounding it. I see consciousness and morals. I see youtubers and podcast producers warning me about bad investments, discussing issues such as acquisition disorder, and warning me about bad investments, without any vicious agendas. Creators who are critical of the industry and themselves, while simultaneously celebrative of a great hobby, and a great community. 

This rant was prompted by my anger at Wyrmwood but the source of my words is a long lasting issue we have. I know it’s capitalism, and I know no-one is forcing me to buy these games, but I didn’t know about many of the things I mentioned in this post, and I hope someone had told me about them, or that I at least had the perspicacity to do my research before committing these mistakes.",,11,,0,,public
boardgames,can't remember name of a fun game I played,False,3,0,"About 3 years ago, I was winery hopping with friends in southeast Arizona (Sonoita) and at one of the stops we met a man who pulled out a game with colored playing pieces. He told us the rules, they were very simple. It's multiplayer: 4 ppl played first, then 3 ppl. It was HIGHLY addictive, very fast to play, and easy to develop your own strategy. I'm so sorry that is all I remember with confidence, but here are other details that are fuzzy:

It's some kind of winner-take-all game where the goal is to collect all of your colored pieces (or one of each color??) or cards - likely -  or else get rid of all your pieces or cards (less likely).

I think there was some element of chance as with dice or dealt cards, or both. The dice/cards may have been colored.

There was opportunity to adopt and try out strategies, a way to approach how you would conduct each turn. But strategy options were simple and limited.

I think it was played in one round (as opposed to phase 10 which takes many rounds). It was relatively fast to play, 5-10 minutes. I think it was played in turns. There was no scoring, pretty sure.

It was fairly compact and portable. I mean, the guy was basically taking it from winery to winery on a wine tour bus, and able to play it with strangers on a small picnic table.

I don't remember if it had a board, like a cardboard playing surface, or a wooden pegboard as you might put pegs onto. It might have.

I expect a lot of down votes for this. I'm basically describing every game in the history of games. I'm confident  that I would recognize it by its name, or a photograph, or even a description of gameplay. I'm not an avid/expert board game player, but I have played IMHO a large variety of games and I had never seen this before.

Any takers?",,9,,3,,public
boardgames,Question for Dominion collectors: do you still play the game the more expansions you own?,False,11,0,"I was a huge dominion fan for several years and played often. For most of that time I cycled around two expansions: dark ages and intrigue. I got a lot of mileage out of those two expansions. Then I started ‘collecting’ dominion. I have almost all of the expansions to date now and have figured out a storage solution to house all of them (wooden artist box). At this point however, the game is so huge and heavy it sits around unplayed way more than it used to. I’ve played the game several times since where I mix in all the expansions, but the games aren’t as interesting to me. I feel like dominion works best when you’re only playing with one or two expansions at a time.

I’m just wondering for the folks who’ve ended up collecting all the expansions, do you still play dominion frequently? 

I recently got one of those quiver card carrying cases and I’m thinking of just using that to have two expansions out at anytime to play the game. There’s something about having all of the expansions that makes the game feel less inviting.",,8,,11,,public
boardgames,Betrayal at Baldur's Gate: one shotting the traitor,False,31,0,"Yesterday we dug out this game for a family 5-player. The pre-haunt game was pretty short, but my Dwarf Barbarian managed to score a Berserker's Axe.

The haunt began suddenly, and the specifics are unimportant. On my first turn, I moved to the traitor's location, rolled 8 dice to attack, and got 7 2s and a blank. Instant kill. The Dwarf looked around and said, ""Back to the tavern, ye laggards. Drinks are on you.""",,6,,31,innovation,public
boardgames,schyte. where is the interaction? (non-euro gamer perspective),False,0,0,"So... I'm not much of a gamer. I DO love boardgames but I never managed to find good gaming groups. I have friends here and there that I play different games with. With a couple i extensively play summoner wars. I have a cousin I don't see much anymore with who I played MTG quite extensively. A friend that is a harcore videogamer and LOTR fan with who I play some dungeo crawlers (but he only likes coop games and heavily suffer from AP). Some other non gamers absolutely love wiz-war. 

So when a long lost friend of mine came visit our group of friends all excited to play scythe I was so excited for it.

I'm into this shit so while not being a euro gamer I found the mechanics really smooth and easy. It was a bit frustrating seeing my friends taking so long to grasp the mechanics but it's ok. They are not so used to boardgames and I'm used to cope with it. Just patience.

Soo.. The game was very smooth. I found the mechanics interesting, various and fast flowing. But the combat was seriously underwhelming and everything else felt like playing alone and the other people didn't matter at all.
I found the lack of interaction with others really off-putting to be honest.
Again, I'm not much into eurogames and I still found the experience smooth and interesting. But from such a top rated game I was expecting a little more?",,22,,0,,public
boardgames,Terraformig mars expansions question,False,16,0,"Hey lovely fellaz!

&amp;#x200B;

We started to play TM this weekend, only the basic version and we have a hell of a time with it. Now i am thinking about getting some of the expansions. My question is what you think about what i think :)

&amp;#x200B;

So i thinking about getting Prelude as its recommended like in all YT reviews. I want to get Hellas and Elyssium for case we want to change our map. And the third expansion i am thinking to get is Colonies to add more stuff to game.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to skip Venus next as i watched some reviews and from what a heard there, a lot of time its not worth time/effort and maybe keeping players from the focus on terraforming mars. Another one i want to skip is Turmoil because we are far from good at this game (on the box there is 90-120 minutes, we went for 4 hours per first games - yea we were drinking a bit but not much :). If i am not mistaken Turmoil adds and complicated the game lil bit more than we feel its right after 4 games played.

&amp;#x200B;

Also i have option to get the promo player boards that were part of Turmoil kickstarter edition, so i am getting these just for pure comfort while playing.

&amp;#x200B;

So if anybody more exprienced as me can advice me if my idea is good or should i change somethin i ll highly appreciate it and any other opinions :)

boardgames,I got to play some out of print games and here are my quick thoughts.,False,1,0,"We have a convention here in Grand Rapids, Michigan and I went a couple weeks ago with one goal in mind. I wanted to take as much advantage of the out-of-print games in their library as I could. 

Here’s a quick review of all the games we played: [Grand-Con Quick Reviews](https://youtu.be/A0ffTsqGwLY)

Here are some games I got to play that just aren’t easily found right now:

**Sub Terra**
**Yellow &amp; Yangtze**
**SCOUT**
**Summit: The Board Game**
**Nova Luna**

As I mention at the end of the video I’m probably saved by the fact that these are out of print because I know myself enough to know I would have ordered them all off gamenerdz before the end of each play.

Quick superlatives:

-game I’ll be quickest to buy when it’s in print: **SCOUT**

-game I know I’ll never buy at secondary market prices: **Sub Terra**

-game I might talk myself into paying secondary market prices for: **Yellow &amp; Yangtze**

boardgames,Kickstarter games that would improve by being less premium,False,185,0,"Final Girl is my pick. It's my most expensive game at $300. As an all-in backer of both KS, I regret going all in. I love the game but I think this game is one of the biggest victims of KS bloat. It's all style over substance. It's a relatively light 30 minute solo game at its core. But everything is made to seem grander than it is.

The VHS-style boxes add a ton of time to setup and cleanup. You need 2-3 boxes for a game. And if you use the killer and location from the same box, you have to remove all of the contents and turn the box up-side down because the location and killer are on different sides and the covers are used as the boards. And the amount of content in the in the boxes isn't a lot. Hans for example has 23 normal-sized cards and the killer board. Camp Happy Trails has 8 normal-sized cards, 33 mini-cards, 6 tokens, and the location board. The production goes against the type of game it is. If the location and killer boards were on cardstock or cardboard, you could consolidate the game into one bigger box that would make setup and teardown so much easier. For quick games, a fast setup and teardown is important because a third of your time with the game shouldn't be spent on those things.

I get it, the VHS-style boxes add a ton of shelf presence. But let's talk about table presence for a moment. Everything from the KS reduces from it. Minis don't serve the game well. The play area is tiny and it's not right in front of you. It's only about 8-1/8 x 5-7/8in. The locations typically start with 8-12 victims and more can be added with events. That's already a decent amount of meeples for the area. But they're bright yellow. You might also have the blue, white, and yellow special victims. Then you have a bigger red meeple for the killer and a bigger purple meeple for the final girl. You might have tokens for items vehicles and minions. The vignettes don't have killers but use tokens for the bird and zombie minions. When you consider the small space and the distance from you, it actually does a good job at being easily readable. But when you add minis, you're just adding a bunch of grey to an otherwise colorful game. They also take up more space on the small board. It just reduces clarity and makes things harder to see. Series 2 is adding vehicle minis and minion minis for the vignettes so there could be more grey.

The minis are optional. But let's say you backed the KS and didn't get the minis. You still would spend $180. And if you didn't back the 1st campaign. The gameplay all-in on the 2nd campaign is $210. It doesn't feel like a $180 game and it's definitely not a $300 game. In terms of true solo games, it's tied at #1 for me. But I find it hard to recommend because while the gameplay and theme are stellar, it feels like a horrible value. I realize that the big production of the game is what attracts a lot of people to the game. It wouldn't have the same buzz without the premium-ness. I can't help but think it hurts the actual game.

What other games do you think suffer due to the trend of making everything premium?",,159,,185,,public

This is already in the works and a custom Catan or Ticket to Ride is not even close to as much fun.)

1) Obviously I will emphasize RAW for these: you do not get money for landing on Free Parking, you only get $200 for landing on Go, you must do auctions. 

2) Everyone starts with 2 random properties which they pay the full price for before starting. 

3) Highest bidder goes first

4) Starting money lowered to $1000

5) Only 3 houses and then a hotel (vs. RAW 4)

boardgames,Card games similar to Magic but last a lot longer?,False,58,0,"My wife and I recently got into Dice Throne and enjoyed it quite a bit. We start with 50-75 life (I think 50 is standard but we like longer games). Either way games with the randomness of dice and decesion making take at least a good 30 minutes. There's a ton of back and forth usually and it feels like a battle. That being said we have most of the characters and were craving something a bit more complex, a bit more variety so we looked into MTG.

Long story short I played Magic 20 years ago and playing competitive with my wife in DT we got interested in Magic. We got started decks, nothing crazy powerful. We are having some fun... but I don't recall the game being so 'quick'. I guess that is the idea, but even with a few decks we are getting bored. There's a little back and forth and again we are not optimized and learning but we've had a few games go into turn 10+ though it seems pointlesss since you end up with tons of land but not many or no cards left in your hand to actually play since the game went on too long, but that is 20% of games. Most games seem over by turn 6 or close too it.

Looking online it seems like most MTG games are shorter at least from stats I read. I dunno know to me 15 minutes into a game turn 6 or 7 is where I want the game to get interesting and not be ending. Now  I understand the quickier games are over for Magic the quicker you see the same stuff/cards/decks and the more you want to make them... but wee don't have to much interest in making 20 different decks to use together (I know some products make that easy).

I guess long story short the structure of MTG makes games feel over as soon as they get going. What other games offer something longer and more like a 'battle' between two people?

Question: Does Cemetery only reveal the top 4 cards of the discard, with the necessity that the sequence can never be disrupted? That is, if you discarded them, you need to remember what they were and when to pull the trigger? I would assume this is the case and that there's no shuffling/randomization baked into the action of the word ""reveal.""

Question 2: When changing seasons, it's unclear who goes first for the next season. The way we played, it was the player directly clockwise from whoever took the ""prepare"" action last. In this way, the player who took the most actions in later seasons must go last at a catch up mechanic. Is this how you play?

Finally, the rulebook says players who have finished the game cannot receive resources. The FAQ also says players who have finished can still have their buildings used (eg post office).

Someone at 6 victory points can potentially get lucky with the rolls leading up to their turn, and manage to build multiple roads and play a knight, claiming longest road and largest army all in the same turn.

While many people may like this style of gameplay, I find for me and the groups I usually play with, it leads to an unsatisfying end to the game.

Hence, the **House Rule:**

It is incredibly simple, and **only changes one rule.** You may declare victory on your turn as soon as you reach 10 or more victory points as usual. However, **after you declare victory, you must maintain your lead for a full round.** Meaning, it must get all the way back to your turn, and you must still have the most victory points.

The other players can prevent your victory by taking ""Largest Army"" or ""Longest Road"" from the lead player, or by exceeding them in points. (i.e. getting to 11 victory points when they only have 10) In the event of a tie in victory points, the player who declared first still wins when it gets back to their turn. Another player can only win if they get you below 10 victory points, or they **exceed** you in victory points. However, even if someone manages to exceed you in victory points, they must also maintain that lead until it gets to their turn again.

It creates a really fun end-game dynamic where all the players cooperate frantically to try and take down the top player, and also creates the interesting scenario where you must decide whether to reveal your hidden victory point development card now, or wait until you have a more secure position.

I quite enjoy playing this way, but, like any house rule, it will not be everyone's cup of tea. I'd love to hear other people's thoughts on this. Is it something you'd consider trying?",,22,,0,,public

boardgames,Hot takes on Essen Spiel 2022 hotness,False,139,0,"Hi all,

Last thursday was my sixth time at the Essen Spiel con. Employing some of the gained experience (intended time of arrival, parking place, entrance, plan for the day), we managed to snatch everything on our wish list, which coincidentally overlaps a lot with the BGG hotness. I wanted to share some of my hot takes on these games with you after our first plays since.

Some general remarks:

\- I am a true euro gamer, some favorites include Feast for Odin, Brass, Concordia.

\- English is not my first language.

\- These are HOT TAKES, not reviews! All games may evolve at multiple plays, player counts, states of mind, etc.

**Maui**

We played this family weight tile-laying game with 2P at the convention and had high hopes due to the combination of publisher (Next Move Games), artist (Chris Quilliams) and designer team (known from Jaipur, Botanik and more). 

I'll cut to the chase, this play was a disappointment. The production is very average and some components are straight up bad for a retail price of 35 euros (I'm looking at you, flimsy single sheet cardboard boards). While the art is cute and mellow, it is also very repetitive. Finally, gameplay wise, it was fine. The core mechanism is choosing towels to make color matches, to advance on generic point tracks. There is some strategy involved in the 'direction' you want to move up and down the board as you can pick up little bonuses on the beach (again, pretty boring set collection). I found the little economic sand dollar mechanism mostly frustrating, and my overall feeling was that this game would get old very quickly. However, it plays in 15 to 20 minutes and there is a variant included which I have not played that might add some depth. Not for me, might be fun for families and kids.

**Heat: pedal to the metal**

Very anticipated game since we all like Flamme Rouge. Played this 4P at the hotel, just 1 race on the USA map without any of the modules. It played very snappy, and the race took us 30 minutes. First impressions are very good, and this is the game I have been thinking about the most since playing it. There is a cool game of chicken going on around the corner/slip stream mechanic, and the push your luck of boosting fits right in. However, I am happy that there are different modules included, since the base game is very.. basic. A little less going on than in base Flamme Rouge as you pilot 1 car instead of 2. The price is justified since the modules/content is plenty and production is top notch, in Days of Wonder fashion. Anyway, can't wait to play a championship with all modules next week!

**Astra**

Played this yesterday at home with 3P. Did not read into this game at all. I think it's Mindclashes first family weight game You fill in stars on different constellation cards in a communal tableau using dry erase markers, and the person who finishes a constellation gets to keep it and use the card for its special power and a set collection end game scoring. People who contributed get to choose a boon. When you run out of stardust which is used to mark off stars, you take a rest action. I found a part of the rest action very annoying, since you get to refresh your acquired and used cards, but only if the elements depicted match the one on the main bord. But you have no agency over the displayed element; it just rotates clockwise between 4 types, after every other rest action. 

Overall, it did not feel like there were many interesting choices to be made and I felt little enjoyment going through the motions. At least it didn't take long (30-45 minutes). Components are good, but I don't get why we have to dry-erase instead of just having player colored stardust to be placed on the cards. It's always a bit messy with dry-erase markers.

**The Great Split**

4P game at the hotel. This game is slick and stylish as heck, and pictures certainly don't do the foil / metallic elements and excellent recessed played boards justice. It is a pretty light game, I would say slightly above Ticket to Ride weight. Everything revolves around the titular I split/you choose mechanism, which fuels an array of goods/contract tracks. Every track has it's own way of scoring, and they are all interesting and viable. There is more player interaction than expected, as it is imperative to keep track of you neighboards when you decide how to make your own split, which you hand to the left, and the split you get to decide on, which you get from the right. After the first round this game played very snappy (&lt;45 minutes) and overall left a great impression on us all. With the setup and scoring variability included, I think this will be an excellent filler, and also a very interesting welcoming game for new players. The only problem that comes to mind is one similar to Puerto Rico; an experienced/good player receiving splits from a newbie/bad player will probably have an edge for the whole game, as you go clockwise for the whole game. However, for this weight and lenght this isn't a problem for me personally.

**King of Monster Island**

Co-op King of Tokyo / New York sounded like a recipe for succes for me - I like these games, but my wife strongly dislikes the negative interaction and player elimination. Played this at 2P (with wife) and had a blast. The production is amazing, with usual vibrant King of \*\*\* art, chunky dice, fun cards and now also a volcano dice tower! The easiest scenario (Crystal Dragon on easy side) was not much of a challenge, but the game totally delivers the King of \*\*\* experience in co-op mode, with wacky powers, unpredictable events and big turns that make you feel awesome. I did not have a light weight dice chucking 30-45 minutes co-op experience yet, and this fits that category perfectly.

**Flamecraft**

Cuteness overload, played with 4P at hotel. This was the last game we played that night, and were a bit tired, and it took us a bit longer than 60 minutes. First of all, the value of this game is INCREDIBLE (I am talking about the standard, non-deluxe 35 euro version). Amazing artwork, neoprene playmat, large high quality cards, screen printed player dragon meeples; just hold this game next to Maui, and you will scratch your head how they can have the same price tag. The game itself is a clever action selection / resource gathering / contract fullfillment game with fun positive player interaction, as shops get progressively better, and you get the feeling of building the city up together. One of the artisan dragons (which got played frequently) lets you gift resources to other players for points! There is also plenty of variability in shops, fancy dragons and helpers, so replay value seems good at first glance. Overall, loved it! A good vibes family-plus weight game. Might be troublesome for very analysis paralysis prone players, as there is a lot of different stuff to do, and the choices open up even more as the game progresses.

**Atiwa**

I am a BIG Uwe fan, and was super pumped for this one. To our surprise, Atiwa is pretty different to his other farming themed games; it certainly is not the next Agricola/Caverna. Tip for new players/teachers: include a dummy first round of the game, since I found it hard to wrap my head around the game flow after hearing the rules explanation. But, after the first round it all clicked. We finished it in 60 minutes at 2P.

This game has an intriguing ecosystem of animals, trees, fruit and fruit bats which ties in beautifully with the core worker placement mechanism. I like that you can't aquire more workers, like in Nusfjord and Ora et Labora you play with 3 each round of the game (because in Uwe games that let you get more workers, it usually is the easiest path to victory). The art and production are fine and what you expect from Lookout. Concluding, I enjoyed the first play very much. However, I am worried whether this game has legs so to speak. There are limited ways to earn victory points and the breeding mechanism is dictated by the same prerequisites each round. It feels very inefficient to not work towards these prerequisites, as it literally gives you free stuff, and the amount of actions you can take is limited (to 3 workers time 7 rounds). We will see.

**Lacrimosa**

Maybe THE hottest Essen Spiel 2022 game? The queue for Devir was the longest one for sure :). Played two times already, at 2P and 3P. Long story short, it lives up to the hype. A very expensive game at 70 euros, but even the box in shrink screamed 'premium', and after opening it I think the price is justified. Stunning artwork, way better in person than on pictures, and every component is top-notch and designed with a purpose.

I will not delve into the mechanisms as Candice Harris wrote a wonderful in depth preview on BGG which I highly recommend: [https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/136882/spiel-22-preview-finish-mozarts-requiem-lacrimosa](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/136882/spiel-22-preview-finish-mozarts-requiem-lacrimosa)

We all loved it. The game is heavy, but plays very smoothly and is laid out intuitively. All necessary information can be found on the board / components, and ultimately every turns boils down to picking 1 card for it's action and 1 for it's income from a selection of 4. There is subtle interaction in all sections of the board; memory cards and opus cards you eyeball/work towards might get snatched, the travel mechanism uses a shared pawn which means locations you want to visit might get snatched or you move further away from them, and the masterpiece commissions are an area control game between 2 composers you can support. At 2, the game was pretty mellow and a bit more loose, but at 3 there was already plenty of competition for the best cards/spots/commissions. I imagine that the 4P game can get cutthroat and you have to pivot your plans even more often. Out of all games played, this one impressed me the most, and I look forward to explore it further at all player counts and solo.

**Crossing Oceans - sorry, this is a bit of a rant**

Last and sadly least, my biggest disappointment of this Spiel. Concordia is a 10/10 game for me and I cherish my copy, singed by Mac Gerdts himself, blinged out with all expansions, maps and insert. This game.. is not that. I bought Transatlantic the year it released and thought it was fine. I sold it after a couple of plays as Concordia gave me a similar experience, but better. This game was supposed to be Transatlantic 2. I have to report that this is not even a 1.5 version, and in my opinion a huge step backwards. I seriously wonder why and how 5 years of development were necessary to arrive at this stripped down, worse Transatlantic. Played at home at 2P.

More than 75% of the components are literally Transatlantic components. There is also an upgrade pack available to convert your game to Crossing Oceans, point for PD Verlag for that. The components, and the artwork (I think only the main board has artwork that is new compared to Transatlantic), are servicable. I hate the paper money.

The game removes the Concordia-like cardplay and replaces it with a rondel. A very BORING rondel. In the process, like half of the actions from Transatlantic got removed, and certainly the more interesting actions. Furthermore, you can't see what the actions do anywhere? There were player aids mentioned in the rulebook, but they are not listed on the components list, and are most certainly not included in the box. Very bad decision, as now the rulebook has to be kept at hand for at least a couple of rounds of the game.

Furthermore, not only actions got cut, but also scoring opportunities. You just score for money, pieces on the board, and a set collection mechanism of boats multiplied by 5 tracks on the player board. No more scoring for rows, no more scoring during the game.

The result of all this? A game that is boring, has a clear 'best action' each round, and kind of plays itself. I have 3 green boats, what do I do? I max the green tradehouses. I have maxed out my green tradehouses, what do I do? I buy as many green/wild boats/docks as possible since they score 10 points each. Now I have no money, so I play the actions that earns me the most money. Rinse and repeat. I never felt smart playing this game and was done halfway, but, it dragged on (about 90 minutes). Oh, and to make matters worse, the weirdest end game mechanism makes the game drag on even LONGER! After the deck runs out all players have not one, but 3 more actions to go through. Never again.

Mac, I hope you can now let the steam boat theme go, and focus on something new..

I hope this was informative for some of you, and remember, these are subjective opinions based on first plays!

I therefore decided to sell some to local game stores for their ""Stay &amp; Play"" areas. 

This got me thinking: I much prefer having a smaller, refined collection of games that get played more frequently as this makes me feel like I'm getting my money's worth and also means I'm more likely to remember the rules!

##FAQ

**I live in Peru/Canada/Jamaica/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the fundamental democratic values of my county are falling apart!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on this growing new thing called LSD, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

Upon doing a little research I found that these two people filed hundreds of cases against game stores  and companies nationwide.

Anthony Toro and Jasmine Toro are the two parties involved in the filings.

So far they've sued Crafty Games of Washington, Games of Berkeley in California, Black Rowan Games in Tracy, California, GMT Games in Hanford, California,  GameScape North in San Rafael, California, GameKastle and more.

They're not really looking to see if these sites are compliant, they're simply sending out demands for settlement.  Regardless, if you own a game store, or know of one, let them know to get their site tested immediately for ADA compliance, hire a company to handle the lawsuit when/if it comes, or simplify their site in such a way as to make it ADA compliant.

We're losing our gaming spaces and friends in the community to these trolls.  These people have no intentions of making the world better for disabled people, they're only looking to make money.

boardgames,"Familiar Tales - clarification needed on Era 2, Chapter 6, Scenario 1",False,5,0,"I marked this post as a Spoiler so I won't be adding spoiler tags to individual bits of information in the post itself, so if you clicked to reveal this post out of curiosity but don't want anything actually spoiled for your Familiar Tales campaign, turn back now.

The scenario is titled Pengrauss' House and the story trigger that I need a clarification on is 602. The familiars grab the tome that Pengrauss had hidden away from Lord Perish. In the narration it explains the book is crazy heavy and Blaze says the group will have to travel light. It then has this bit of text...

&gt;Each familiar can only bring one item card in their pack. A familiar's starting item card does not count towards this limit.

If I'm reading this correctly the game wants us to trash EVERY item we've crafted so far or have gained from story moments (both equipped and in our Stashes) expect for 1 item each + starting cards?!?!

That's such a massive loss out of nowhere that I had to ask a second opinion on if this is actually what it is telling us to do or if I'm just misunderstanding something. We've been doing good making sure that we forage everything whenever possible so we've managed to craft *everything* in the item deck expect for like one weapon from Era 1 that we didn't really want anyway. Throwing that all away would be totally brutal.

Please no specifics spoilers for the story following where I am in the game but if there's some explanation like ""don't worry, you'll get a bunch of great stuff early in Era 3 to make up for it"" that would be both reassuring and not what I'd consider a spoiler. Thank you

Edit: I don't think I left anything out of my post that would be important, but if you want to see some pics of what I'm referring to, here you go. I think the scenario is on page 45 (or if not, it's right around there) of the scenario book

boardgames,Discussion on writing in board games.,False,7,0,"I don't mean rulebook writing but all the other writing;  what you read in game intros, flavor text, text based games, books published related to a game, apps, and so forth.

What writing had been memorable to you?

**Galaxy Trucker** is probably the one that sticks out most, especially because the flavor text in the rulebook helps reinforce the rules, which you may have used when explaining the game to newcomers.

Mixing flavor text with the gameplay; somewhere out there Ben Croshaw is cracking a smile.

Shout out to the Rocky Road novel as well!  The whole truck driver scam chapter felt like a lost Douglas Adams notebook.

**Mice and Mystics** was rather enjoyable.   Especially the chapter midway in the book where all heck breaks loose and every game mechanic dumps into the same battleground!    I can still picture what was happening in my head.

Sadly, that is all that stands out to me.

---

Is it me or does good writing in board games feel lacking?   Of course this opinion is coming from me, someone who has no experience with writing and ""more of a math guy"".

FFG in particular all feels, well, bland. 

I skip the flavor text on Arkham games after 10 years of seeing them.   Descent 1st and 2nd edition felt like fantasy templates to copy and paste.

The Hour of the Huntress, one of many in the Asmodee library of stories, just didn't interest me enough to read any of the other board game novels like Arkham, or the Terraforming Mars novel.  Has anyone read that book?

Oh and the apps.   Destinies gets some points for some silly things like arm wrestling the king of Bavaria but all these app games are like ""you need to find a mushroom.  You fail to find the mushroom.  There is a door instead, the door has a sturdy lock and you can't just hit it with your axe you started the game with.  That would be rude"".

Now of course what players themselves come up with will be far more entertaining amongst themselves.   How many of you picture Jenny Barnes as a Duel weilding John Woo badass who don't take no sass?  Who imagines the jock from Betrayal at House on the Hill whose battle cry is shouting FOOTBALL before punching a monster right in the face?

Maybe that is the goal?  Less effort on flavor, more effort on a blank slate for the player to fill?

Video games today however are a joy to read, with indie titles like Outrr Wilds, Disco Elysium,  or anything by Greg Casavan to name a few.  Could quality like this be transferred to board games?

There are obviously three individuals who would do best to provide such insight: Cole, Drew, and Ricky.

This insight won’t cover changes between the first edition of the game to this one, it will simply show some of how the design of the new edition changed over time.

# The Board

There are several things that evolved on the board. I think there were maybe 3 main versions of the board overall, with minor adjustments being made or even flipping back and forth within each version. The original board design at launch of the Kickstarter ([https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/361/619/a1771c0e3bc94fa5fef51db4957c1cd3\_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1619973354&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d06cb91e31fb3cd2c25a482b22a1f099](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/361/619/a1771c0e3bc94fa5fef51db4957c1cd3_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1619973354&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d06cb91e31fb3cd2c25a482b22a1f099)) looks quite similar to the final design today. The ribbon layout, VP track, and India map are all basically the same as the final printing.

You’ll notice the game turn track is on the top right and next to that was how the policy wheel was handled for laws. There was a token that would move around that board similarly to how the PM wheel works now, and then there were chits that would slide down the center as a means of showing the Power Value of things such as Luxuries and Shipyards. The number of chits for an item represented how much they were worth (start of game Luxuries were 2 and Shipyards were 1, but if a policy caused another chit to get slotted in the Luxury chit below would get pushed out).

The 2nd iteration (snagged from Cole’s playtesting via Discord: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/813093035767234570/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/813093035767234570/unknown.png)) brought us closer to the final design, moving the prizes to the left side of the board, and moving the Army boxes vertically down the center. The biggest change here though is the Court of Directors has shifted up (and also worked a bit differently).

The final design ([https://boardgamegeek.com/image/7033488/john-company-second-edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/7033488/john-company-second-edition)) moved the policy wheel off the board to a separate game piece, put the court of directors back to basically where it was, placed the game turn track at the start of the ribbon, added a pensioners box, a votes tracker on the right side, and many minor adjustments (and gorgeous art).

# The Game Flow

Promise cubes made their way over from the first edition of the game, and even had end game VP implications ([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/793875394415034427/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/793875394415034427/unknown.png)) These cubes were eventually removed altogether and little systems were added to replace them such as simply getting consent from players verbally to allow nepotism hiring, and adding Promise cards as additional means of bargaining.

Where the game currently uses an Opportunity Marker to allow for momentum buildup with Family Actions, the original action economy was based around a family’s children being used to get things done. Players would receive a child (family token) and be able to use that to thematically send their child off to work at the shipyards or workshops (to gain the enterprise card), send them off as a writer, or enlist as an officer. Initially, based on player count, you would receive 1 or 2 children in a round, with rounds alternating. You might start round 1 with a single child to take a single action, and then round 2 have double the action economy which could be split between different things if desired. There was even a promise card, “Child as a ward”, where someone could cash in to gain your precious child for their own action. This was a fun system as it felt restrictive, made the “Child as a ward” promise incredibly intriguing, and allowed you to diversify your actions when you had more than one child. This is a system that many earlier play testers miss, myself included, but the loss of action flexibility is replaced with each player making more difficult decisions for their actions, deciding if they want to stay the course to gain the benefit of an action twice, and potentially opens up negotiations with others as my ability to buy 2 shipyards this turn means maybe I’ll buy the second one for you if you can make it worth my while.

The secondary income known as Power was originally called Prestige and was earned in similar ways through Prestige cards (and if you were a Commander when the game ended). Power for Trophies and Laws Passed were added later. The concept of VP for those with the most Prestige was still a thing ([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png)) as well as converting assets. Prestige VP eventually changed to a flat +4/+2/-3 VP whereas those with most and second most Prestige got 4/2 VP and whoever had the least lost VP. Sucks to suck. Later on the idea of the VP gain being varied based on what turn the game ended was added.

There was a point if the company was successful, you would have a Final Retirement phase which required rolling for attrition, retiring these pieces, THEN paying the overall upkeep of your prizes. Now you don’t have to pay upkeep for these final retirements (phew). I can’t remember if upkeep was required even in the case of company failure back then, but it certainly isn’t now (which has absolutely put me in situations where I needed the company to fail else my precious old people would get kicked to the curb!) Also the cost and VP gain for prizes were adjusted once, maybe twice, with the larger prizes ultimately getting boosted for both if I recall correctly.

**Other misc items:**

There was also a point where the game could have a “Courtesy End”, forcing company failure if every share in the Court of Directors consented. Wacky!

Things went back and forth on bonus writers via the 4+ vacancies rule. This was something added due to circumstances (especially with lower player counts) where there weren’t enough writers and too many offices to fill and thus offices were just never hired. At one point the rule was you treated the Enlist Writer action as if your opportunity marker was already on it (meaning if you hadn’t taken Enlist Writer last turn you could take it this turn for 2 writers) to what it is now which is just a +1 meaning those with opportunity can gain 3 writers for this action (making it a massive 4 if Tenure Limits is in play). Haven’t seen many issues with offices not getting hired after that change!

I recall tweaks were made to the way Company Standing and Debt were handled, and what effected these items. Rebellions used to cause Standing to go down, then didn’t, then did again! But now it’s simply if a region is lost. The debt track disappeared altogether at one point and was handled by company standing track.

The timing for when Shares entered the Court of Directors changed back and forth a few times. It used to be during the Hiring phase, and then there was debate whether it was okay to have shares enter before the Firms phase, and now it’s been simply added to the end of Family Actions with the clarification that new shares can’t be invested into firms. Easy.

Company Failure cards were a crazy “last minute” addition. This was near the end of development as we were fighting over how Governors should work, and Cole thought that there needed to be a balance to make players working actively against the company have some fear of repercussions. This also replaced the “end game noise” that was lost from the removal of Hidden Interest cards. They’re one of the wilder ideas in the game, but they add a dramatic flourish!

# The Prestige Cards

Prestige cards were very different from the split between enterprise, spouses, and blackmail cards we have today. There were doubles of each card in a deck of 40. Then these were replaced by a deck of 48 cards with 6 copies of 8 suits which had different power and ways of scoring. A the end of the game you score each suit of prestige cards you have in hand and play area. The powers and scoring method were designed to encourage negotiation and reward specialization. I may have joined a bit later (and my memory is fuzzy) so for those who remember the older cards and how London Season was handled please chime in! Checking my notes I see mentioned of prestige card adjustments that made marriage worth 2x prestige, 3 Bishops being worth 6 and having a vote and inheritance, alterations to the number of prestige cards based on scenario setup.

Eventually we got to the simpler system of 3 cards in the display, and whoever spends the most for retirement gets first dibs. Blackmail cards were initially Secrets, with hidden scoring conditions for the end game (like have the most promise cards from other players). In retrospect I do miss this element quite a bit. Eventually Blackmail cards came to be with sneaky actions people could take, and power values were added to them. There were even some that still had “Hidden Interests” which were goals to achieve that gave you 3 power at end of game (like have most shipyards). The power used to be viable only if the card was played, then it was decided that having the card period was good enough to keep the power value.

Spouses were eventually changed from being worth power to being worth straight VP with an offset of some kind of limitation for the game. One last addition to spouses (which I contributed but Cole and I may have just been on the same page during that discussion) was to give Spouses a discount on retirements. There were a few ideas thrown around for some kind of retirement benefit with spouses, and the discount won out. I have made incredible VP gains from having a few spouses with discounts that really add up!

# The Enterprises

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png)

While ultimately small changes overall, Enterprises kind of went through a wild ride. At the start Shipyards cost £3, Luxuries were £6, and Workshops were variable depending on the Company’s balance. If the company made less money in a round Workshops would be cheaper, but if the Company made more money Workshops would be less (and you may have to pay upkeep on them). This was a great system that I didn’t get a chance to play with too much before it was removed entirely for a fixed cost of £4.

Now workshops are £5, worth 2 votes, a passive income of £1, and will earn you a VP if the company fails. As seen above they used to be worth passive income of £2 and didn’t get you a VP. If you invested a Workshop you lost your votes, but this was eventually altered.

What feels pretty late in the design process there was a sudden decision to drastically reduce the cost of Shipyards and Luxuries. While it may not seem like a price cut of £1 is all that much for Shipyards, let me tell you it alters the dynamics of the game a LOT. Suddenly it’s easy to want to snag another shipyard, and they can be financially lucrative now as they recoup their costs quicker. This was one of the more exciting changes that occurred, and made us raise our eyebrows and go, “oh wow, that’s nuts”.

And let’s talk about Luxuries getting slash from £6 to £5 to eventually £4! That’s a massive discount for 2 VP and makes Luxuries something that players will actually go for. Before this change these were things rarely sought after, except maybe a late game boost. Now they’re a reasonable grab, especially for players who either just have extra coin to spend or who need to make up for lack of retirements. You’ll notice that these now are subject to a Window tax (as are the prizes) which was another concept added much later in the design to penalize more successful players.

# The Offices

**The Chairman**

\- Used to start with a Prestige card off the top of the deck.

\- Court of Directors had a fixed maximum of 6 shares, and a specific way of handling the vote for the new Chairman which totally eludes me at this point so if someone remembers chime in. Eventually the court size was eliminated, and elections were simplified to a majority vote for someone.

\- The Chairman used to not count as a Share, but now does. Also, the way they handled debt has been altered. Now the Chairman can take a whopping 3 debt without any permission, before they needed consent from the court, or at one point needed at least half of the court’s approval. Chairman also had a Special Envoy action that allowed them to peak at cards and remove all chaos (now what would simply be a closed order) from a region.

**Director of Trade**

\- Used to be allowed 3 transfers.

\- Special Envoy from Chairman office was moved to DOT with their treasury being spent on dice for the check. This treasury had a max of £5 then £6 but eventually the limit was removed.

**Manger of Shipping**

\- Used to have to fit player ships first, but then was given allowance to fit Extra ships instead of desired. This certainly made a big change in how this office operates, as now Shipping has some leverage to negotiate with other players versus simply going through the motions of the job. “I’ll fit your ship for a pound” should be etched into the side of the box.

\- Extra ships were an interesting addition as well, allowing for more flexibility for larger trades even if players hadn’t invested in enough shipyards. I can’t remember if Company Ships were always indestructible, but I believe they were. Player ships didn’t always have the ability to flip on fatigue though.

\- Shipping could also their own shipyards if there were no player ships to fit, but these shipyards were replaced by Company Ships to make things easier.

**Military Affairs**

\- I’m not sure much if anything changed here. If I’m wrong let me know!

**Commanders**

\- Commanders used to get exhausted like any other office, but were changed to only get eliminated on catastrophic failure (and eventually changed based on majority of officers.

\- Commanders used to have 2 actions, which basically got rolled into the singular Deploy action later in development. Commanders could either quell unrest in an EIC controlled region (remove unrest and open orders) or they could invade. Now the singular Deploy action does one or both of these things depending on the targeted region, making things a bit simpler. Regiments used to get death checks as well, in the case of failed invasions or lost offices. Eventually Regiments were made to become Terminators that couldn’t be killed, and the death checks were altered in several ways.

\- Death checks used to be a standard check, then became something that happened if a skull was rolled during a Commanders action, then were changed to being required for all officers used during any Commander action but only being eliminated on 6s. There was a lot of tweaking the death check system and way the armies worked. Regiments now being permanent fixtures means the company needs to be careful about adding more, as they (like company ships) are going to be an increasing expense that will likely never go away (unless we were to go to War with France perhaps).

\- A new loot system was put in place where the player with the most officers took half rounded down, then the next most took what remained, with anything left going to the presidency. Then the system was just rolling a die after successful invasion and getting the amount rolled, split between folks. I believe actually that the die with the skull had a few different loot values on it and so you’d invade, if successful roll the loot die, and then get to split the loot amount or people died if the skull was rolled.

\- Regiments were changed to not get loot and not cost upkeep, then eventually changed to being part of the loot split and being an expense.

\- Having a Commander at the end of the game used to gain you 1 power, and then this was removed entirely. Eventually power was added back by Commanders gaining trophies for successful invasions or defense against attacks. Region loss caused a Commander to lose all of their trophies, but eventually was changed to half rounded up.

**Presidents**

\- The Presidency used to have a strict order of Commanders, President, Governors. Eventually this was swapped so that Governors acted first, then Commanders, then President. Fairly late in the development Cole realized that it didn’t matter with the way each of these offices had been tweaked and the President could just be given the opportunity to choose the order (and often times there are much more optimal orders depending on the board state such as Governors going first to give Commanders regiments to open up closed orders for the President to trade, or President guaranteeing a trade first and then deciding to give remaining money to Commander for local alliance, etc etc)

\- Used to only be able to trade X orders where X was the lower between number of ships and writers. Eventually Writers were no longer a bandwidth limitation and the generic writer was introduced (which has now just become the Filled Order token). Writers also didn’t always get a bonus for being used (but we love that they do now don’t we!)

**Governors**

\- Went through a LOT of changes, especially during a specific few weeks near the end of development where both Governors and Governor General went back and forth through different iterations until Cole finally decided on something he was happy with. Some folks miss Governor version 3.0 whereas we settled on 5.0 or whatnot, but where things landed is likely the most streamlined and easier to utilize.

\- This office used to have their own treasuries, get Bonuses during Bonus phase, and could invade. They would due things like tax but decide if they wanted to keep a buck for themselves, request money from the president, commission regiments, quell chaos, and build permanent forts which increased defense or build infrastructure which increased value of orders.

\- Eventually Governors no longer needed money for checks and had a dice value based on the region (indicated on the Gov card) +1 if all orders were open in that region.

**Superintendent of Trade in China**

\- Used to act after Bonus phase. Used to get opened and then had to be filled next turn during hiring, and worked like any Presidency in that it required ships and a treasury to spend for checks. Eventually China was given a jumpstart in that the office was immediately hired upon creation and was given £5 and 2 Extra ships so it could trade that turn. This was ultimately simplified so that it used the number of ships for the check, thus not requiring a treasury.

\- The India board used to have Plantations that would dictate how much money China would make for trading. Each plantation was £4 per plantation. Eventually plantations were swapped out for built Opium Icons on the board. As long as EIC controlled that region those icons counted towards the China trade.

\- The saddest change to this office, which affected the board as well, is the Opium Icon was switched out for an Exported Goods icon. Thematically the opium trade was getting going at this time and the China office is EIC getting that ball rolling with their plantations. Because the game is produced in China, and because China is super sensitive about opium (for obvious reasons) Cole was advised he needed to change the icon as a poppy would cause problems. The opium trading had to be dumbed down to generic exports.

**Governor General**

\- This position went through many tweaks as well, which I don’t really recall entirely. As with the Governors, GG went through a dramatic season of changes until Cole was satisfied. The dice pool that the Governor General utilized was something that eventually made its way over to the Governors.

**Commander-In-Chief**

\- This position used to exist! It was like the Governor General, and even had it’s own law card to create the position. This removed all commanders, replaced Military Affairs, and Commander-In-Chief was now the sole controller of all things related to the army.

**Prime Minister**

\- Prime Minister used to be attainable by simply being the one who had the most votes for a law passing. Eventually the Leader of the Opposition was added, requiring someone to have the most votes against a law that ultimately fails to snipe the PM. Again, something that seems to have been a bit earlier than my experience, but it seems laws were something divvied out to players and the PM could pick in their hand or another consenting player’s hand. There also didn’t used to be pass/fail conditions on laws, but I’m not as familiar with what this looked like (I assume fairly like how laws might have been in first edition, again those who know please chime in!). PM was also not worth Power initially but is now worth 2, good enough reason to try and steal the position in the end game yeah? Though, pro tip, consider that PM position is the ultimate tie breaker for things such as Prestige Card choice and even end game…so either having the position or helping someone closer to your right have the position can be very important.

# The India Map

\- Plantations existed in specific regions and provided the value for China’s trade. Eventually Plantations covered open orders and increased these orders by £5.

\- Order values across the map were tweaked. Some were lowered, others raised (Hyderabad went from £6 to **7).**

\- The number of open orders had a penalty of region strength including empires like when invading.

\- There were specific differences between a rebellion occurring in an EIC controlled region and an invasion from another region coming into our territory. Invasions had to manage the strength of the region/empire, where rebellions were solely the unrest. Eventually a rebellion in one EIC region caused unrest in all the regions. Then unrest was added to the total strength of an invasion as well as being strength for rebellion. Now if the company gets invaded it’s chaos everywhere on the map. There was a lot of small adjustments with how the unrest cubes worked, what they counted towards, and how different crisis events were handled. Some were more difficult to keep straight than others, but things should be considerably more clear now with how there’s basically 3 defined events now (Rebellion, Invasion, or Attack against the Company).

\- The loot system changed many times over for commanders, and the amount of money looted also was altered by changes to the Governor tokens and then adding £4 per tower level to incentivize a greedy invasion against a stronger region.

\- Cascades would simply be ignored or only go so far if they couldn’t be actioned, but Cole decided that cascades should cause cascades and now we’re all aware of how important it is to keep specific orders open as often as possible to avoid horrible things.

\- The Elephant used to move around based solely off the Event deck, but Cole noticed that India wasn’t behaving as dynamically as desired (or as he stated, “India was self-cannibalizing a little too dramatically and I was finding situations with 2 empires (let alone 3) to basically never be happening)…” and thus few changes were made. A - regions used to be capable of Collapse, which would occur if a region needed to remove a tower level but didn’t have one. This caused all orders in the region to close and may have had other implications that I can’t recall. B – Tower level decreased on failed rebellion/invasion instead of whoever was the loser between the crisis. C – Imperial Ambitions was born to provide moment to a successful Invader so they’d move to take over another region instead of the Elephant moving off elsewhere.

\- Obviously there were a number of other changes made to the Event deck itself, balancing out the frequency and types of events, how the Elephant would be directed, and other minute details that Cole would probably need to key you in on to appreciate.

# The Firms

\- Unfortunately, I didn’t jump into the firm game until later on, though I did get to experience one or two large changes to how things were being handled.

\- Deregulation rules changed multiple times, with deregulation being mandatory when the company hit specific spaces on standing or debt (see the green spaces in the older boards).

\- A debtors prison was a fun idea suggested by someone that was added later on, and how/when people could invest in firms shifted around a bit. You used to have to trade company shares 2:1 for firm shares if standing/debt were on what are now striped spaces.

\- Firms used to provide power but eventually were changed to VP based on company value and shares. Before it was anyone who had a share in a firm received the power it was worth I believe. Craziness.

\- The way shares and ships worked in firms went through some adjusting. There wasn’t always a cap on shares if I remember right, and the +1 to ships was added later on to allow for smaller firms a better chance at success. The best change was the way initiative was added with ships minus successes being an indicator on who gets to roll first. This allows smaller firms a chance at success with larger firms existing, as more ships means chances are you might be trading later for half value. These things really evened out the firm game and allowed much more flexibility and viability for different types of firms to exist and function.

\- I suggest anyone who really got to dive into the firm games as it developed chime in and provide insight as I only have so much!

# The Crown

The solo game didn’t change too much over the course of things, as you can see from this preview ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c9NJ-DRI2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c9NJ-DRI2o)). Many changes were due to Ricky needing to keep up with development tweaks to all the many elements of the core game. Overall, the way The Crown runs and behaves stayed the same, with the brilliant Promise Cube system being used as a way to gain leverage and negotiate with the AI. There were changes to promise cube values of course, how much is needed to spend to get The Crown to behave this way, or how much do I gain from doing The Crown this favor. There were also plenty of opportunities to edit or add additional ways for players to interact with her.

Some things were added over the course of testing to ensure things remained balanced and challenging. Little annoyances like players as Chairman needing to give up a cube each round or being forced to give cubes if opening a firm. At one point there were variable VP gained based on how many cubes you had at end of game, but eventually this was done away with. The -VP penalty for company failure was added as a great way to ensure you are working hard to keep the company afloat or have ensured your position can take the hit from company failure cards and the like. The climate of the Crown changed a bit, with things like “anchor” and “bell” being changed to “Fox” and Stag” or however it shook out. The personalities behind these climates remained intact from what I can tell.

Originally The Crown would do everything in her power to gain and keep the Prime Minister position, not caring at all about the laws and simply acting in a way that would obtain or retain PM. Eventually Ricky got fancy and was able to create a dynamic system for The Crown to care about each law depending on climate and circumstance. She would also spend money and votes towards her cause, which was then tweaked to the variable bonus votes based on treasury.

The original Crown Handbook was over 60 pages, basically dedicating an entire section to each climate. You would have a section that was for Bull and it would go from Chairman to China and then the next section would do the same. This was a nice layout, but it was frustrating to jump between the sections based on climate (despite it only changing once per turn) and didn’t allow players to see at a glance what the dynamics were between climates. I will take full credit here and say I spent far too long putting together an alternate handbook with intention to share to BGG that ultimately became the current Crown Handbook. The handbook format/layout as you see it today was what I compiled, copied over by Drew and prettied up and edited as necessary for the final print. I’m incredibly pleased to see that something I had worked hard to make as a benefit to players ended up becoming the official format for how folks will play the game.

One last thing I can think of is the Crown Climate shift itself. I had brought up how it was somewhat frustrating that I could, as Chairman for example, know everything The Crown was intending to do for the round as I figured out treasuries and such. I would know her behavior and desire to act this way or that. I could ensure I didn’t give too much to a Presidency that would fail to act or give her the opportunity to squander cash for something harmful. Ricky had stated he was playing with an idea to give the Crown a little bit more unpredictability. Other than at the start of the game, the only other time you would draw a new AI card was during Parliament Phase to get a new climate and see how The Crown would vote. An additional Climate change was added to the Chairman phase, and cleverly to the beginning if Crown or after if player. This meant that I as Chairman would have to go through the motion of planning the round without knowing exactly what climate I was getting. Great! However, Ricky wanted something a bit more dynamic in the climate shifting and thus the Shift Climate section in the Parliament Phase was made. Ricky went through different iterations on how exactly this played out, but he ultimately settled on what we have now which allows for dynamics based on the company’s standing. This element alone took a bit of work to get down right, mostly to ensure players would perform it properly (I might be the reason the rules clarify “failure + catastrophic failure” when simply saying failure should be enough…).

# The End

This was pieced together from scouring the announcements channel in the Discord and from my own memory and experiences playing the game over the past year and a half. As I said, there are far more experienced players who have spent so many more hours playing this game who can likely provide some great insight (and possibly a few corrections to my info above).

I was lucky to have a friend group who took to this game and allowed us to play dozens of games as testers, and I was fortunate to get to work somewhat closely with Ricky as I focused more of my plays on the solo game with a handful of other awesome people. I’m incredibly excited to see what comes next for Wehrlegig and Ricky, and am looking forward to testing and helping out in anyway I can to make these projects the best they can be.

I encourage those who were along for this journey share your experiences. I’m also happy to answer any other questions the best I can.

boardgames,WSBG Vegas 2022 Review or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Fact that Nobody Knows WTF is Going On,False,226,0,"a short (?), sweet (??), and scathing (!!!) review of my experience in Vegas...

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday: there are two Ring Events this night, 7 Wonders and Splendor; so far, so good, everything seems fairly well-conducted. I check in at the desk at the front of the Tournament Hall and I am given my table and my seat number, all is well and the night proceeds...

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday: my Ring Event this day is Wingspan, 9a start time - I check in at the front desk and I am given my table and my seat number. The ""player board"" tournament template that was introduced by the WSBG organizers started to be exercised, and it gave me some measure of confidence in their interest in conducting a fair and structured event. However, I noted at this time that there was no common game clock: games started when they were ready, and neither judges nor tournament procedures were ever introduced. When we needed assistance it was necessary for somebody from our table to get up and seek out somebody that looked like they might be a ""judge"" (???). Surprisingly, during our first game we were told by somebody who looked like a judge that we had \*\* 4 hours \*\* to complete the first round -&gt; this loose time control will come in to play again later in this review...

&amp;#x200B;

Friday (the cracks begin to show): As I did for the previous two events, I went to the front desk to check in. Somebody who ""looked like a judge"" (recall nobody has ever been formally introduced, they can only be recognized by standing in the right place at the right time wearing what looks like the right shirt) told me to ""go to the back corner of the hall"" for my game. I did so, and then somebody else wearing the right shirt asked me ""did you check in?"" -&gt; to which of course I responded ""no, I was told to come over here"". He then told me to go back to the front desk and check in... so back to the front desk I went, where I was admonished, yelled at and asked ""who told you to come up here? go back to the corner!"" -&gt; ???. I return to the back corner of the hall, somebody new wearing the right shirt shows up and tells everybody to find their name and seat number on a placard on one of the 7 tables and prepare for their game. After everybody finds their seat there are over a dozen players still milling about, confused that they have not been seated. The tournament organizer (?) that I previously mentioned starts reading names, covering all of the players who have not yet been seated, and tells them to step aside and be seated at another group of tables. Then, we are instructed to begin our round when we are ready. It seems like a rather small field, and then we come to find out: of the \~40 players that signed up for the event, for some reason \*\* 13 \*\* players were given a first round bye!! What was supposed to be a 4 round Ring Event (where the winner advances to Sunday's semifinals) was now at best a 3 round event where 1/3 of the field was given a first round bye...

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday, the final day of Ring Events: Dune Imperium

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;&lt; the degraded experience as the days went by prepared me for the s#!t show that was to come, and I was not disappointed &gt;&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Dune: Imperium -&gt; a sold out event (1 of maybe 2?) and arguably the crown jewel of the tournament given the game's popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

The first round was scheduled to start at 3p (already rescheduled twice) and when I arrived to check in I found the doors to the tournament hall closed. I opened the door and walked to the check-in desk.

&amp;#x200B;

“What game are you here for?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Dune”

&amp;#x200B;

“Game start has been delayed, please wait outside the hall and we’ll call you in when we’re ready for you”

&amp;#x200B;

...a sign on the door would have been helpful, but instead they had to make this same statement to at least 30 other people that opened the doors and went inside over the next 45 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

\~45 minutes later somebody wearing what looks like the right shirt comes out and instructs us to start lining up for check-in, again this game is sold out so we’ve got 256 players to get seated at 64 tables.

&amp;#x200B;

Check-in is complete, everybody is seated, but nobody has come around to instruct us how to proceed. After a few more minutes my table decides to reach out to the table next to us and swap game copies with them so we can start getting set up (recall: everybody had to bring their own copy of the game for the Ring Events that they signed up for, and you couldn’t play with your own copy so swapping like this is how it usually went; also note that fewer than half of the players at my tables actually brought copies of the game, so who exactly were these instructions for??).

&amp;#x200B;

My table is all set up, we're chatting, I have a good group of players and I’m feeling like this is going to be an enjoyable session... some more time passes and it looks like literally nobody is in control, besides being given table and seat numbers at check-in we have not received any instruction, so I get up to go find somebody who looks like they are wearing the right shirt to ask when we are starting the round and was told “oh, if you’re ready start now” grrrrr... so we did.

&amp;#x200B;

As the first round of the game starts we are all being very deliberate and taking our time, making sure that we all understand the ""player board"" template rules and deciding upon the conventions we want to establish for ""pieces played / cards laid"" etc. -- During this round a player at our table brings up a rules question and offers what they think the answer is; I agree and I am ready to continue the game, esp. as the question has nothing to do with anything currently happening on the board and was more “what if” based, but 2 other players didn’t agree with the interpretation and wanted a judge ruling at that moment. So our table calls for a judge, one comes over and discusses the rules and chats about where to find a valid ruling as they search through print-outs (rule book vs. published errata vs. BGG Dennen posts etc.) and just generally wastes time that didn’t need to be used at the moment, but whatever... 25 minutes or so go by and we get back to the game and we finish the first round of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

We start the second round of the game and another rules question comes up re: “are discard piles open information?”. I answer “yes of course they are”, a player at our table disagrees and wants a ruling, and this one I’m happy to get officially resolved since it should be quick \*\*and\*\* I know I’m right \*\*and\*\* I intend on using this during the game. A judge comes over and tells us “no, discard piles are not open information” ?!!?. I ask for them to bring another judge over, and after some rule book and errata investigation (along with more unnecessary casual chatting) the second judge decided to rule that “you can look through your own discard pile but not your opponent’s”, arghhhhhh !!!! To which I replied “if that is the ruling that you’re going to hold us to you are going to have a room full of very upset players, because every other player here knows that discard piles are absolutely open information” - but that was that, the ruling was made and we continued our game (another 20+ minutes spent on this unsatisfactorily resolved matter).

&amp;#x200B;

\^ not 10 minutes later I overhear the same question come up at a table in the next row, somebody who looks like a judge appears and immediately rules for that table that “yes, discard piles are open information”... so I guess there’s just different rules at each table ??

&amp;#x200B;

My table begins the third round of the game (for those unfamiliar, this game usually runs 8-9 rounds of play), we are finally looking like all of the B.S. might be behind us and we can get on with playing the game - halfway through the round one of the judges (the same from our first “rules question”) comes over to say “you have less than 40 minutes to finish your game” —— WAT

&amp;#x200B;

“the round ends @ 5:30”

&amp;#x200B;

How can that be, I ask? The round started late, and in fact every table started at different times since nobody told us when to start or what the time controls would be (recall we had 4 HOURS for our 1st round of Wingspan, so it never crossed my mind that time would be an issue here) - in addition, at least 45 minutes of our game time thus far had been wasted by judges who didn’t know what they were doing and seemingly had no problem taking their time and chatting us up using our game time !!

&amp;#x200B;

But that was it, the game ends at 5:30, finish it up - so then everybody at the table tilts, players at my table start yelling at each other, everybody rushing for whatever scraps of points they can get before time runs out, misplays abound (myself included), it becomes a giant clusterF..

&amp;#x200B;

My table is at the beginning of round 7 of the game when the same judge comes by again to tell us “game ends in 10 minutes, at that time finish the round and declare a winner” - at least that’s what I heard, 2 other players at our table heard “game ends in 10 minutes, finish THIS round and declare a winner” which makes considerably less sense, why bother telling us how much time is left if we’re just supposed to finish the current round? So this needed another judge ruling / clarification (and this one was actually necessary, since this absolutely impacts play for the next set of turns) - a few more minutes are wasted, the judge that comes over can’t give us a decisive answer (??) so says “I will go get an answer for you, I’ll be right back” — which doesn’t really help...

&amp;#x200B;

Half of the players at our table want to continue the game in the meantime, certain that this was indeed the last round and playing for the points to make sure they can secure the lead until the end of the round; myself and another player believe we can finish this round and get to the next one before time is called, and of course we both want that ruling as it puts us in the position we want to be in... but in truth nobody knows for sure what is going on at this point, everything is FUBAR

&amp;#x200B;

The round ends, everybody has exhausted their resources / screwed up their plays / tried to position themselves to reach a win condition at the time that they \_believed\_ the game would end.

&amp;#x200B;

The judge comes back and says “don’t worry about the time, just finish the game to completion”.

&amp;#x200B;

...and all hell breaks loose, my table is about to be flipped, \_nobody\_ is happy about this, none of us have reserved the resources or the play options to successfully plan to play this out.

&amp;#x200B;

Each player in our game was convinced they would have won in a different round given a different ruling on when the game was supposed to end...

&amp;#x200B;

Time to breathe, reliving this as I typed it out was fairly traumatic... there is no world in which I would ever do this again with these rank amateurs, this event was so poorly conducted, I feel incredibly duped; they were in no way prepared to succeed at a venture at this scale, despite marketing themselves as if they were; the resources exist in the gaming community that would have made them successful, I do not understand why they did not take advantage of them.

&amp;#x200B;

boardgames,Ready Set Bet has been an absolute hit with my game groups!,False,14,0,"I picked this up last weekend on a somewhat whim. I had heard it mentioned on a podcast but couldn't remember much about it, other than live action horse betting.

I didn't really have anything like it so I said why not; And since then I've played a half dozen times. 
Nobody ever wants to play just once. It's wild and chaotic, and always gets people talking (often shouting). starting out it seems pretty dull and slow, but As soon as bets starts hitting the table the excitement builds and everyone gets into it.

You don't bet money like other games, instead you bet with tokens that will multiple your payout based on how well a horse scores. There's also exotic finishes, prop bets, and side VIP cards for even more options. These other options can kind of be a lot to add for new players, so there is an option to leave those out.

The horses are controlled by one player being the ""house"" and rolling dice to see which horse moves. It also comes with a great app that allows everyone to bet and nobody needs to play the house. It also features an excited commentator who will loudly announce the big changes in the race.

All in all it was a great experience, and so far I've played in groups as small as 2 and big as 5 with people old and young. It plays up to 8 people (9 if someone is playing the house) and I look forward to how hectic it'll be with a full complement of players",,6,,14,,public
boardgames,Basic board game bag? (EU),False,2,0,"EDIT: should have made the title say *backpack* instead of *bag*.

For a while now I've been using a [standard Cajon backpack](https://www.thomann.de/de/sela_se_090_cajon_backpack.htm) to transport a larger amount of games on foot. For 30x30 game boxes or smaller, it's almost as perfect a vessel as can be, except the *slight* issue that it's not made with a 20kg load in mind (3-4 boxes with inserts and expansions and you can easily get there).

Which means that [disintegration](https://imgur.com/a/LCJHacu) is the inevitable result of using it for a while. Now, I'm prety sure this would not have happened if the stitched reinforcing straps went over the edge and connected with each other to distribute the pressure away from that edge, which is a real minor change. There are more expensive cajon bags around than €25, but they all seem to share this design issue of unrefinorced pressure points.

There's plenty of classical solutions like IKEA bags or shoulder-strap sports bags, and also many [overengineered](https://www.amazon.de/ENHANCE-ZAINO-GIOCHI-TAVOLO-Rinforzata/dp/B07W7LFCRV) [overpriced](https://shop.level3b.com/collections/frontpage/products/the-game-canopy) [special](https://www.ebay.de/itm/202632385139?var=502709526100) board game bags, but my tentative conclusion is it seems best to buy a cheap cajon bag and pay a handbag repair shop €10-20 to reinforce the top edge. I'm just surprised given how easy a modification that is there don't seem to be any such items on the market in the corresponding \~€30 price range.

Am I missing something? Do yall have any tips on practical and fairly priced game transportation solutions that

boardgames,[New to Clank!] Does Clank! have a first player balance issue?,False,3,0,"I finally bought Clank! last week, and everyone I played with loved it!

However, a common observation was the fact that usually the first player won. Out of 8 games I played with differenct groups, the first player won 7 times. And out of these 7 times, only once the difference between the highest and the second highest score was less than 10. 

Adding a single extra Clank! at the beginning of the game seems to be the only way to balance the first player advantage. Adding a single Clank! doesn't really seems to make any difference, comparing with the advantages of moving first, and cycle through your discard pile faster.

Some games like Viticulture automatically switch first players between rounds, while games like Champions of Midgard let you choose to waste a worker to be the first one next round.

It added a whole other level of strategy to an otherwise fairly random game.

Since that game isn't made anymore, I've been looking around for something similar, but I haven't been able to find any dice games for kids that include this kind of flexible sorting element.  Does anyone happen to know of such a game?

boardgames,September victory - Pandemic Legacy Season 1,False,10,0,"&gt;!\[edit\] Adding another spoiler warning in case it shows up for some reason in previews as it did for at least one person.!&lt;

&gt;!Text follows.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Start:!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!After a BRUTAL first game in September where our Soldier was revealed to be the traitor and we flamed out spectacularly we picked ourselves up and tried again.  New member of the team - Anita the virologist who loathes the scientist, Fiona.  (Rivals)!&lt;

&gt;!We had an absolutely incredible start.  The one disease we'd fully 'upgraded', black, was not placed at all during the setup infection phase and we had sufficient black cards by turn 2 (scientist) to automatically cure it.  (She needs one fewer, the disease requires one fewer, and no action needed so when she drew her cards and got a third black on top of the two she had to start, it was done.) Amazing.!&lt;

&gt;!But then:  on turns 5, 9 and 13 the first player drew an epidemic card!  We were furiously trying to quarantine and/or remove faded figures - nearly the whole board has faded cities now - and just barely keeping it at bay.!&lt;

&gt;!Eventually we cure yellow, and get enough cards to the scientist - 4 - to cure red, but that's her final action so we have to survive one more go-round.  We've already sabotaged two bases, so all that's left is quarantining 7 cities, so that (plus preventing outbreaks) is our focus now.!&lt;

&gt;!With only I think five cards remaining we finally pull one of our funded events - we used two thanks to losing the previous match - and it was the one permitting the addition of two quarantine markers anywhere.  Incredible timing.!&lt;

&gt;!With that we just barely managed to get to the Scientist, luckily didn't get the fifth epidemic, and win.!&lt;

&gt;!Following the match we have: !&lt;

&gt;!18 cities stable 13 cities unstable 10 cities rioting 3 cities collapsing 4 cities fallen!&lt;

&gt;!Every continent has at least one Faded city except Asia. South America is in the best shape overall (no unstable cities, one faded).   We have no structures in North America any more; Europe has a few but is completely Faded, being the home of city zero (Essen).!&lt;

&gt;!Peeked ahead at October: looks like we're on the hunt for patient zero!  Thinking we need the operations specialist as we've lost a lot of structures to our own sabotage and of course rioters tearing down research labs!!&lt;

&gt;!Such a great game.  We're loving it.    Thirteen games over seven months to get to this point.!&lt;

&gt;!One thing I have found really interesting is that we are 50/50 win-loss with zero funded events in the deck.  Except our first game that we completely screwed up, we are 100% wins with any funded events in the deck.!&lt;

boardgames,Betrayal at House on the Hill Question: How do you use the laundry chute tile?,False,12,0,"Okay, my friends and I have the 3rd edition of Betrayal at House on the Hill. We’re in a heated debate over the laundry chute tile. It reads “Leads to the Basement Landing. If you end your turn on this tile, place your explorer on the Basement Landing.” 

One group reads it as this… The “leads to the basement landing” part implies you can use this to get to the basement anytime. If you run out of movement and end your turn on the laundry chute, you place your explorer in the basement without a choice. So if you’re exploring new tiles and you use your last movement speed to discover the laundry chute tile, since your character landed on the chute, they have to go to the basement. They fall down it essentially. 

If you have plenty of movement speed and discover the laundry chute tile, you can choose to jump down it and continue exploring the basement. You’re only forced to do it if you meet the condition of being out of movement. 

One group reads it as this… The laundry chute leads to the basement, but you can only go down it if you end your turn on that tile. So if you have 3 movement speed left, you can’t go down the laundry chute, but if you use up your movement and land on the tile, you’ll go to the basement. “If you end your turn on this tile, place your explorer on the basement landing.” The only time the condition is met and you can use the laundry chute is if you end your turn on that tile. 

Does it make more sense that you can only go down a laundry chute if you end your turn there or does it make more sense that you can go down a laundry chute anytime as a one way ticket down and if you end your turn there, since you’re out of movement speed you’re forced to fall down? 

Considering barriers, movement impairments from enemies, limited tiles leading to the basement. Which is more balanced?",,27,,12,,public

Spoilers follow!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**CAMPAIGN WITH WIFE:**
She played Daisy (cluer) and I played Roland (fighter). The first scenario went swimmingly, with our team netting 6 experience points each by the end. The second scenario was definitely a step-up in difficulty. We were only able to interrogate two cultists (almost a third) before midnight struck. We played the third scenario last night, and it was a disaster. I pulled both of Roland's weaknesses in the first few rounds, and then all of the leftover cultists showed up. The end boss arrived, and we had little chance of winning. I had Lita in my deck, but she was three cards from the bottom.

Not going to lie, it was pretty discouraging. If you don't throw Lita at the baddie, you have to whittle away at his 14 HP, all while trying to deal with his 6 evade, or you get slammed with 3 dam/hor *every round*.

**CAMPAIGN WITH BROTHER:** He plays Skids (fighter build) and I play Wendy. I play through the campaign with my wife first, so that we can experience the shocks and surprises of the story together. With my brother, our games are always better because I know what to expect. We wrecked the first scenario and interrogated 3 cultists (almost 4) in the second. We haven't played the third yet.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**CONCLUSION:** The third scenario wasn't just tough, it honestly seemed fairly impossible if you don't draw Lita early in the scenario. We were SO excited about the game and loved the first two scenarios, but that third one is so poorly balanced that it took the wind out of our sails. I'm really reconsidering spending the $70 for the Dunwich campaign, especially because I've heard from other posters that it's easy to get behind the first scenarios and crash and burn mid-campaign.

Full disclosure, I already bought the Dunwich Investigator box, but haven't looked through it yet because I wanted to try the core campaign with only core cards. So what are your thoughts? Is the Dunwich campaign less soul-crushing? Is it worth picking up?

boardgames,Alternate way to end Lords of Vegas? Thoughts?,False,4,0,"So me and some friends all played Lords of Vegas for the first time last night. Fun game. But we didn’t love the mechanic of how the game ending was time based as opposed to score benchmark based. Now, we’ve only played it once, so I wanted to hear yalls opinions about this who have played it way more. The issue was one player was WAYYYY ahead as we approached the 3/4 mark, turning the game into a situation where there was no real chance of a comeback and thus greatly diminishing the fun for the last 4 turns or so. Is this a rarity? Is it just because we admittedly were playing pretty badly strategy wise since it was everyone’s first time? We were brainstorming about doing something like getting rid of the game over card and instead playing to a set number (70 or so) and then just going through the deck and reshuffling if we reached the end.

boardgames,Using fictional themes to explain abstract game mechanisms,False,3,0,"Fantasy, sci-fi, and other fictional themes are often used to help explain abstract game mechanisms that don't feel relatable to the real world. **Small World** does a great job of using familiar fantasy races to help you understand and remember some abstract abilities. 

On the other hand, some fictional games fall into the trap of inventing thematic jargon to make the game feel more unique, but it can actually make it harder to understand the game.

I won't go into details, and I know plenty of people have bought them without any issues, but unfortunately my experience wasn't the same.

I don't want to disparage Board Game Tables, they have been very kind and helpful in the return process and they are a small business, I'm sure getting tables to people across the US is difficult and I commend them for even trying. And I say take my experience with the Jasper with a grain of salt - after all, I did plenty of research before buying a Jasper and the sheer number of positive reviews made it seem like a really safe choice. And it definitely still is, I think I just got rather unlucky.

That experience made me rethink the entire concept of paying so much for a table. I decided paying a massive premium due to the niche nature of board game tables as a product just isn't worth the possible hassle if the QC/shipping gamble doesn't go your way. I was concerned about longevity of the table pretty much the moment I opened the box, which isn't promising from a $1.5k product. Again, this isn't the norm from my research, I just got unlucky.

Anyways: Anyone have any non-board-game table recs? Honestly I've just been looking at IKEA since I live close to one. Used to have a Bjursta from there that I actually quite liked, but sadly they discontinued that table it looks like. But I'm open to any recs from anywhere.

boardgames,Games that overstay their welcome,False,173,0,"I was at a board game meetup and played Lost Cities: The Board Game for the first time with two other people.

After the second round I was kind of out of it but was trying to not look bored or anything as the other two were enjoying the game more.

boardgames,"Weekend Play Report (3 new to me games, 2 oldies)",False,8,0,"My mother-in-law was up this past weekend so I was able to sneak off to a friends house for the weekend, at least until I was called back due to a sick child. I was able to fit in 8 games though, so not too bad for a trip. 4 were completely new (thought it was 3 when I wrote the subject, a rookie mistake), 2 were oldies, and two got played twice. Here's the breakdown:

1. Vengeance (Played at 2 players and 3 players)

The non-roll and write Vengeance was an absolute delight. It comes in 3 parts, a one-time set collection draft (which is later supplemented in other rounds but the draft happens only once), a dice draft and buy phase, and a roll and attack phase. Each part would be kind of meh, but the sum definitely exceeds the individual parts on their own. The decision of how much damage you take prior to going into a Den; the fun of taking turns where you turn a knife into a gun into a run into two knives and everyone is now dead; the laughs that come with each success and failure; its just all so good. Its one of the few games I found myself rooting for my opponents with each die roll. I will say two bad things about it though: 1) the Rulebook is absolutely terrible and 2) It was a bit more sloggy at 3 compared to 2, but not so much that I wouldn't play again at 3, I probably would pass at 4. Finally, I created the following head-cannon: This is a competitive game because all the vengeance-seekers are sitting at a bar recounting the story of their exploits, and the best story gets free drinks for the night from the others.

2. Street Masters (Played at 2 and 3)

Continuing the theme of beating people up, I found a copy of Street Masters (which was very very tough to do) since it was my friends Birthday and he loves Sentinels but has all that content. It was a good decision, because it played like a Sentinels tactics game, but not like Sentinels Tactics, which was a terrible game. Each turn you move, play a card, and activate a card (or move again, or interact, you get the point). Then the enemy and environment does some things, wash rinse repeat until enough things have been punched. It does feel at times the enemy minions become overwhelming, but we had a good time with it. We won the first at 2, lost when we later played at 3 after knocking out 2 of the bosses 3 health bars. The head-cannon here is if it says 25p (aka per player), each 25 health is a health bar. Of course this has absolutely no effect on gameplay, but if you're going to pretend to be in a side scrolling beat-em-up, you give the boss fake health bars.

3. Flamecraft (Played at 2)

Flamecraft was...fine. On the positives, the game is absolutely beautiful and it plays as a breezy worker placement game. Each turn you take your Dragon miniature, go to a shop, collect the resources showing and then activate a power there. Alternatively, you can go to a shop and cast an enchantment to activate every dragon there. So far so good. My issues are the following: 1) One Dragon seems insanely overpowered, the diamond dragon that lets you collect 3 different resources. Combined with the Potion dragon that swaps and uses and other dragon, we were constantly bouncing these diamond dragons around, filling our coffers with 6-9 resources after casting an enchantment. It seemed like every other dragon mattered much much less since you could use the diamond dragons to use enchantment turn after enchantment turn. 2) More problematic is the end game, where once end game is triggered, everyone gets 1 more turn. This leads to the situation that if first player triggers end game, they get one more turn than everyone else. Given there's not much differentiation between player turns, an extra turn is a huge huge advantage. I'm curious if anyone else had this issue, because it put a real sour taste in my mouth.

4. So Clover (2)

I'm curious why So Clover, when every other board game lists as wide of a player count as possible, when with a minimum 3 players on the box when it so easily plays at 2. We made our clovers, traded, filled out each others clovers, did the check round, and filled it out a second time. A quick fun time, and I will forever call shoes Sock Devices from now on.

5. Long Shot, the Dice Game (3)

The first non-new to me game, Long Shot continues to be fantastic. Roll the dice, place your bets, buy some horses, start yelling at the 6 horse for not moving forward for the 3rd turn in a row despite you betting the house on it WHY WONT YOU MOVE FORWARD. Anyway, the second play of this game, first at 3, and it once again came down to a neck and neck race for 3rd deciding the winner, which had everyone sweating and laughing around the table. Cant wait to play this one again.

6. Dominations (3)

Dominations is technically not new to me, but it came out right before the pandemic so this is an out of the dust play. I'm a huge fan of the game, so I was thankful to get it to the table. In this game, you place some tiles, collect your resources, and buy a tech which you add to a eventually quilt of cards. Honestly, Dominations should be called Tapestry and Tapestry should be called Dominations, but that's a discussion for another day. This game I went heavy on influence and eked out a 1 VP win (which is more impressive when you consider VP are usually 200-300+ points), 2nd place when a mix of monuments and end of age scoring, and third place was within 20 and went heavy monuments. The one drawback of the game is the massive amount of techs you can choose leading to possible AP or downtime. We dodge downtime by letting others go while someone choose a tech, but we had turns where someone would place a tech and then be told its their turn on the tile placement again. That should lessen the more you play the game though. Honestly, one of my favorite games I played this past year.

After Dominations I got called home to help with sick kids, so a few games like Clash of Cultures, Townsfolk Tussle or My City had to stay in the bad, but here's the Tl;Dr tier list:

Loved:

Long Shot

Dominations

boardgames,New Shop Owner,False,224,0,"You may remember a bunch of months back (January to be exact), someone posted up a Game Cafe for sale for $20,000 (and take over loans) up in Saskatoon.

No, I didn't buy into that. :) 

But I did bring it up with the owner of my FLGS. We discussed the issues with renting board games and table space and providing food. At one point, he mentioned that while he wasn't looking to sell, if he did it would be to me.

I've known him since before he started his shop 10 years ago and he was my Best Man at my wedding a few years back. He and his wife have come to our house for drinks and gaming and we've been to theirs. So we have history.

We started the discussion then. What would it take? How much would you want? Hmmm.

My wife and I discussed it and we looked at our finances and opened serious discussions with him and his wife to see if there was interest. Turns out she was running the business part and he was running the retail part, dealing customers and ordering inventory. There was a third person doing the tech part. Trying out email campaigns, twitter, facebook, and shop gear. Her career was taking off and getting away from the business would let her focus more on her career. The tech guy also had a job and no investment in continuing the tech side of things (everything was pretty old or unused).

As time went on it firmed up and lawyers got involved to create the appropriate documentation. We got asset lists created including the things he wanted to keep. I applied for sales tax licenses for my LLC and we signed papers in August. As of September 1st, all of the assets of the store were mine. Note I didn't buy the LLC, just the assets of the shop which are all now under my LLC.

For the past month I've been taking over control of distributor accounts, facebook, twitter, google, and other accounts that had been started but never completed. I added accounts with game shops like Leder Games, Stonemaier, Steve Jackson, and CMON. Purchased a new computer for the POS. Upgraded the POS. Fixed the security systems. And done some rearrangement of the shop. I restarted board game night (Wednesday nights) and October is Halloween themed with Elder Sign tonight. My wife and I gamed every Wednesday. Now we just go to the shop Wednesday nights :) 

The shop didn't have much in the way of social media presence. I've upped the posting to Facebook and our engagement is over 300% over the past 30 days. I've posted a bit more to Twitter and now have 44 followers (it hadn't been posted to since 2015). I created a discord server that has 75 users after 6 weeks.

I've basically improved the presence but haven't made any changes to the running of the shop leaving it all to my manager. It's been a successful shop for 10 years so I have no reason to muck with that :)

Humorously I got a minor talking to because I was buying my own merch. He knows I'm a collector type and he wants me to let him know what I want as my purchases skews the desire for the product by customers.

In a few years I'll retire and take over the counter. Well, maybe. We'll see how the next couple of years shake out. I may be better at running the business and he needs a job :D

boardgames,A solo dungeon crawler round-up,False,33,0,"I have sunk an embarrassing amount of time into playing roguelike video games, along with dungeon crawlers. There's something about the challenge they promise along with the difficult but rewarding gameplay that really, truly draws me in. Since switching to playing more solo games I've been searching out different dungeon crawling board games so as to try and get that same experience from a tabletop game. Knowing that a number of people are in this together with me, I thought it might be fun to have a look at the games I've tried so far. Hop along, shall we?

I looked at the following games, arranged by after market prices:  
1. One-card Dungeon  
2. Tin Helm  
3. Mini Rogue  
4. Tiny Epic Dungeons  
5. Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion  
6. Space Hulk fourth edition  

And technically Mage Knight, more on that at the end.

What you'll notice is that I don't play very many massive affairs with long Kickstarter wait times and boxes full of miniatures. I'm finding it very difficult to explain to myself why I would buy a 100+ euro game without having absolute certainty that I will get enjoyment out of the game equal to the value that I've put into it. There's some games on this list (specifically Mage Knight and definitely Space Hulk) that most definitely fall into this category, but I could explain those purchases to myself. Mage Knight I bought second-hand for an excellent price before I dove into the Ultimate Edition, and I had played Space Hulk a ton of times before buying my own copy. What I'm saying is that a game has to do a lot more as a value proposition before I will consider buying it the more expensive it is. 

With that note out of the way, let's get started! 

**One Card Dungeon** - 3 plays
What is it:  
One Card Dungeon is pretty much what it says on the tin - a dungeon crawler that's played on a single card. Both players and enemies are dice being moved around, and your actions each turn come from you assigning dice values to your attributes. Make it through twelve dungeons (done by flipping and rotating the dungeon card) to win!  

Would I recommend it:   
Not really, or more as a novelty. One Card Dungeon is very impressively designed, mostly in that the designers managed to make the enemies in the game feel and behave differently from one another just by tweaking some numbers - it really is impressive. That said, I don't think the game has a lot of replay value after you've made it through a few runs. The dungeon lay-out is the same each time, which is not necessarily a big deal if it wasn't for the fact that you see each floor six times in a single run. Added to that is the fact that the dice-driven gameplay leads to a bunch of dead turns where you only really block and hope to find an attack die that does something next turn. It *is* cheap though, so it might just be worth it to you even if you only really get three plays out of it.  

**Tin Helm** - 7 plays  
What is it:   
Tin Helm is the mint tin version of Iron Helm, available only through the Game Crafters. You play as an adventurer delving through a dungeon in search of relic shards that help you break the curse that... Eminates from this place. You'll be combining the front of one card with the back of another to figure out what terrible stuff will befall you in this dungeon. Throw in some dice chucking and you've got a stew going, baby.  

Would I recommend it:   
Partially I would. I most like this game when the result of the flip is largely unknown. The tension in the game really started to dissipate once I started remembering which cards have things on them that give you shards. However, playing the game is a lot of fun! The dice play and stat management is a whole lot of fun, and the push your luck element of figuring out if a room is better as your destination or as the modifier was really clever. My current hope is that the creator figures out a way to make an expansion for this game like he did for Gate, because I'm definitely not tired of the system.   

**Mini Rogue** - 17 plays  
What is it:  
Mini Rogue is a roguelike dungeon crawler in which you explore different floors of either a tower or a dungeon, getting into fights with bosses along the way. Exploring is done by flipping cards on a 3x3 grid, and getting experience unlocks extra dice to use for checks and combat. Throw in a smattering of unique characters, and that's Mini Rogue!  

Would I recommend it:   
I would! Mini Rogue is about as much fun as you can get from a game this light. The characters and character powers are fun, the game is diverse enough and quick enough to get you into a game quickly and get back out, and the character progression feels real good. That said, I will admit that I tired of the base game after quite a few plays because I kept seeing the same few things over and over again. The expansion stuff for the game helped breathe new life into it for me (especially the new characters - that skeleton guy is rad as hell) but after the amount of plays I've had with it I'm looking for new things. That said, it's a very solid game. I've had a ton of fun with it.  

**Tiny Epic Dungeons** - 4 plays  
What is it:  
The Tiny Epic series is known for cramming a ton of game into a little box filled with stellar production values, and the same is true here. This box in particular has a large number of room tiles that you explore in a 7x7 grid space on the look for mini bosses before you can fight the main boss. Players will acquire loot along the way (including loot sets that grow more powerful the more pieces of the set you have) and pilot their heroes in a fight to beat the boss!  

Would I recommend it:    
This is a tough one for me. I personally like it, but the rules for the game are a bit of a mess and the heavy reliance on iconography makes the game hard to parce. I've never beaten the game so far (which I see as a good thing) but I've also consistently had the feeling that I wasn't playing correctly anyway. The boss fight mechanics are weird as heck and I keep forgetting to take damage whenever I reveal a tile with a monster on it. There's also some weird stuff going on with the expansion and the production of the game. I'm not entirely sure that I like the use of both meeples and miniatures in this game, mostly because the meeples look *so good*. The miniatures are not bad, but I'm not sure they add enough to the game. I more feel like they detract from the game rather than adding much; my suspicion is that they were added because many famous dungeon crawlers use minis and so now they feel they had to (looking at you, Gloomhaven). So, if you want a really tough solo or co-op game while being able to deal with weird production choices and unclear rules, I think you can have a lot of fun with this game. It really does have a LOT of game inside that small box.   

**Gloomhaven - Jaws of the Lion** - 9 plays  
What is it:  
Younger brother to the number one boardgame on BGG, Jaws of the Lion is a more streamlined and beginner friendly gateway to the Gloomhaven system. Players will pick a character and play through a 25 part story in which they level up, encounter events and just beat up a ton of monsters. Combat is done through a thrilling multi-use card system in which played combine two halves of two cards to perform their turn. Add in some hidden goals, deck optimization and a dash of openable boxes, and that's Jaws of the Lion.  

Would I recommend it:    
I do in general, but I'm personally not sold on Gloomhaven as a solo game. I truly love the game as a cooperative experience, mostly because there's nothing quite like it. There's absolute magic in a Gloomhaven turn going tits up that you don't really get in other games, and that facet of the game is fully missing once you introduce perfect information. The solo game is most commonly played by controlling two characters, and to me it really erases the magic that is Gloomhaven. However, if you like the combat system in Gloomhaven and enjoy just doing each turn in that game perfectly, you can't really go wrong. The story is mostly disposable, but the encounters and dungeons are really fun and the design going into each of those encounters is second to none.  

Also, I do want to say that I mind the mixing of miniatures and standees in Gloomhaven a lot less than the mixing of minis and meeples in Tiny Epic Dungeons. I am biased towards meeples over minis, but that aside; the separation of player miniatures and enemy standees helps you quickly parce the board and analyze the board in a way that you don't really get in TED. Maybe it's just a matter of scale, or maybe it's just my heart screaming for gorgeous unique meeples. All I know is that I liked the mix in Gloomhaven and actively disliked it in TED.  

Also also, full disclosure; I've gotten rid of my copy of Jaws of the Lion. I can see myself getting rid of some of the other games on this list in the future, but this is the only game that I have actually gotten rid of at this point in time.  

**Space Hulk fourth edition** - 4 plays (solo)  
What is it:  
""Not a solo game and not a dungeon crawler!"" I hear you yell at your screen. Let me get back to you on that. Before we deal with that though; Space Hulk is a game in which you play a group of genetic super soldiers (Space Marines) who are working through different scenarios in order to complete goals in an attempt to fend off a group of alien super killers (Genestealers). Each side of the conflict uses asymmetric rules and powers to try and crush the other side through some fast and quick dice chucking.  

Would I recommend it:  
So here's the deal. I will recommend Space Hulk to anyone who can get their hands on an affordable copy. Compare Space Hulk to the other games we've discussed here, and you'll see many similarities; grid movement, surviving waves of enemies, coordinating a small group of units. Along with that of course comes the fact that Space Hulk is a fantastic game, both two player and solo. The production value of this game is absolutely bonkers, with the thickest cardboard pieces I've ever seen and the fantastic miniatures that have long been Games Workshop's bread and butter. When it comes to the solo game I personally prefer playing both sides with me trying to win as the Space Marines, although you can find formerly official rules in the BGG files section. I really love how tense and difficult it is to win this game as the Marines, and how much fun it is to try and drink every part of their milkshake as the Tyranids.  

However, I can't in good conscience tell people to go search out a 300 dollar game just to play solo. There's no sense in that. So, either make damn sure that this is *your game* before selling a kidney for a fresh copy.  

**Let's talk about Mage Knight**:  
So for me, Mage Knight is the ultimate version of what I'm looking for in a roguelike dungeon crawler. Except of course for one thing; it's technically not a dungeon crawler. The world isn't a dungeon and you get to basically move around wherever you want. Besides that though, I really do think that there's no game like it when it comes to character progression, power escalation and that good power fantasy that I see most other games on this list try to approach in their own way. Really, give the game a chance. It's good.  

**Conclusion**:  
Bang for your buck, I feel that you're going to get a more rewarding experience out of most of the more expensive boxes, although there's a bunch of creative stuff happening in the cheaper boxes. When it comes to depth of gameplay and replayability though, Gloomhaven and Mage Knight take the cake. If you want the most game for the lowest price, I would personally recommend Mini Rogue over the other options (although Tiny Epic Dungeons is not far behind). This genre is probably the most fun I've had playing a solo game, and I can't wait to find out what else there is for me to explore.  

Also, feel free to leave suggestions and recommendations in the comments! If it's affordable I'll definitely try and check it out.",,28,,33,mage-knight,public

2. able to run Java with at least 16 GB of RAM dedicated to two processes with a significant amount of I/O, as well as a few hundred GB of storage
3. a person who has been a professional full-time Java developer for at least 5+ years and can demonstrate that to me
4. a person who has at least 5+ years profile history of being helpful and positive on Reddit, especially but not necessarily on r/boardgames or other gaming subs
5. a person who is happy to agree to a document to never personally financially benefit from recommending board games to people

If you think you match the above, which I think someone on this sub will, let's have a chat! If you think these requirements are too extreme, feel free to express yourself, but I'm confident I will find someone who matches the above and don't really want to debate my requirements.

It's possible that command-line bots like u/boardgamerecommender have run their course and people now only want mobile websites/apps instead; usage has significantly declined in the past couple years. Whether or not that's the case, I would still be willing to share everything this project has taught me with anyone who qualifies under #4 and #5 above.

boardgames,I want to gift a friend a board game but I can’t remember the name.,False,30,0,"UPDATE: solved by Blue Bombardier. Starship Interstellar  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pendragongamestudio/starship-interstellar



My friends birthday is coming up in November. He loves board games. He showed me a video of one he is interested in but I can’t remember the name nor find the video. 

I don’t want to spoil the gift so I can’t ask him out right. If I describe the game can someone help me locate it? 

The game was a space in a spiral looking layout. The sun or black hole (can’t remember which) is expanding and will eat and consume all the planets. Each player is a nation that is moving operations and ships to other planets or moons and what not. Each nation is contributing to a mega ship ark that will take off and leave the solar system. 

Each player wants to leave influence of their country on the ark ship. So researching and accomplishing tasks is how you do so. As time goes on the sun or black hole sucks the tile spaces towards the center and eats those spaces until you run out. 

He said he was interested in it but couldn’t afford it. I think it was plastic heavy.

boardgames,What would be the best location for a new or custom version of Brass?,False,5,0,"I come from an English industrial town that is NOT featured in either original Brass or Brass: Birmingham.

boardgames,SHUX '22 Was Fantastic (you should go next time),False,212,0,"Wanted to give a shout out to the entire SUSD crew for running such an unexpectedly good convention.  Many people commented on how it was such a nice change from other cons (PAX, GenCon, etc.) in being a bit more down to earth and more of a chance to enjoy playing games rather than get swept up in ""con stuff"".

It is definitely one I will be attending in the years to come.  Thank you so much for making this experience possible.

A few observations from the event include:

**Games That Were Always Being Played**

* Inis (seriously, seriously popular)
* Captain Sonar
* Wonderland's War
* Undaunted (multiple versions)
* Ra
* Brass Birmingham
* Terra Mystica / Gaia Project

**Memorable Events**

* When the whole hall applauded the winner of the all-day 8 player TI4 game

* Making eye contact with the person holding a blue balloon (looking for more players) and giving them the nod 

* Quinns, Tom, and Pip employing an actual lawyer from the crowd to recover the madly conceived ""Quinn's Courtroom"" panel

* Getting to chat during the ""sign stuff"" panel

**Con Positives**

* Lots of room to play games, you never had to wait for a table spot to open up

* 4x (4!) simultaneous games of Blood on the Clocktower running nearly all con

* Great lending library; had nearly everything you would have wanted in it

* Super smooth badge process and friendly volunteers

* Meeting lots of great new people when looping in additional players; nearly a 100% pleasant experience rate which is far better than you might usually get in a public board game group gathering.

* Con dynamics meant you could play games nearly back to back for the entire day if you wanted, great value for time

**Con Negatives (Con-Cons?)**

* Not enough Matt. We missed you Matt.

* Odd concession hours.  Tough in a ""no outside food"" venue to have it open late and close early.

**Games of the Show**

* Ready Set Bet (AEG) -- lots of loud shouting and general enjoyment; app is genuinely useful to the game

* Blood on the Clocktower (Pandemonium Institute) -- tougher to run in a loud environment, but I was impressed with how cleanly people could be onboarded and ready to play using only the base materials; was really thoughtful to split out ""new"" and ""advanced"" groups",,56,,212,twilight-imperium,public

boardgames,My experience at the first World Series of Board Gaming in Las Vegas,False,146,0,"I'm finally back from World Series of Board Gaming and it was quite a week. Overall I had a really great time and the use of the Dice Tower West games library for attendees to check out games was absolutely amazing... so many games available to play that it made my head spin!   


But I also think it's important to recognize a few things that could have been done better:   


1. Where games had low signups, some frustrating decisions were made on how to handle the tournament rounds. For example, I was in the Dominant Species Marine tournament, and there were apparently only 22 people signed up for it. This number does not allow for a simple, even set of tables, and so the organizers had to come up with a strategy on how to run the three rounds of the tournament. Unfortunately, they decided to focus on having a four-player table in the final as the main goal, and it meant that they seated only two tables of four (of which I was a player in) for the first round, and gave FOURTEEN byes to the other players, who sat around for three hours while eight of us competed for two spots in round 2. It was incredibly frustrating to feel that I had to compete for a seat in the ""real"" tournament in round 2, and I didn't win that game so I was out, while 14 people ""jumped the line"". A similar issue apparently happened with Gaia Project as well, though I think they only ended up with something like 7 byes in round 1.  


2. Time was seemingly haphazardly dealt with. On Saturday, the Terraforming Mars tournament started at 9am, and I was signed up for Dune Imperium at 3pm the same day. Apparently, one of the ROUND ONE tables of Terraforming Mars still had not finished by 3pm, and for some reason that meant that we couldn't get seated for our first round of Dune Imperium until almost 3:30. That would have been fine.... except that when it got to be 5:00, we were told ""you have 30 minutes left!"" because the second round was scheduled for 5:30, and despite our complaints that we lost a half hour at the beginning of our slot, we were still forced to speed through a few rounds at the end, potentially upsetting the strategy of those at the table (including my own). So then, why were the Terraforming Mars players allowed to play for HOURS past their scheduled time, but then our much shorter time was cut even shorter?   


3. A smaller complaint, but the awards ceremony on Sunday evening was pretty poorly attended because people needed to get to flights and it was held at 5pm. Not sure how to make this better though.  


Again, overall I really had a fantastic time, and I would for sure be interested in competing again in the future. Perhaps after a few years to work out some kinks and growing pains, though.",,83,,146,dune-imperium,public

7 years ago I posted a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3lpjzq/help_please_complete_my_board_game_cafe/) here asking for help regarding a board game cafe questionnaire, I was overwhelmed by the response and what started as a business dissertation turned into an actual business.


Luke reached out to me via Reddit and within 6 weeks I’d moved to Bristol (UK) and 6 months later we opened Chance &amp; Counters (Bristol, UK). Since then it’s been a whirlwind of activity, we’ve:

- Launched a [podcast](https://www.chanceandcounters.com/podcast/) ([video version](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsaJRK56Yo8ESuZByiuFUisHpx5VPzyVv))
- Brewed our own beer
- Opened two new sites (Cardiff, UK and Birmingham, UK)
- Unboxed thousands of board games
- Survived Corona
- Published a [board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/231624/exploriana) 

The podcasts has been our most recent passion project, we’ve had [Jon Purkis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s16NJwUTj1g&amp;list=PLsaJRK56Yo8ESuZByiuFUisHpx5VPzyVv) (Actualol) and [Matt Edmonson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhYG7D1GfDY&amp;list=PLsaJRK56Yo8ESuZByiuFUisHpx5VPzyVv) (Radio 1 DJ and Obama Llama designer) on recently!

boardgames,"[Self-Promotion] I've been working for 5 years on a Pokemon-inspired game that's played with Poker cards, and the first prototype arrived!",False,29,0,"[Here it is!](https://imgur.com/a/kIwEcq2)

The game is called Enmity Engine. It's a horror-themed fighting card game for 2 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes (but can be as quick as 10-15 minutes if you're used to playing). It works like this: Each player has a team composed of 3 Fighters and a deck of Poker cards. Both players have one Active Fighter out at any given time that face off against each other.

Each round, both players take 1 action, then choose a move by setting a card from their hand face-down. Once both players are done, they reveal their face-down cards and, depending on what move cards they chose, resolve their moves, which will either cause them to Attack or Switch their Active Fighter.

Over the course of the game, your Fighters generate a resource called Insight, which can be spent to Awaken them to upgrade their abilities or launch their Signature Moves (kinda like Mega Evolutions and Z-Moves, to borrow Pokemon's terms).

The game ends when one player's Fighters are defeated, after which the other player wins the game.

After playing simultaneous reveal fighting card games like Yomi, BattleCON, and Exceed for a while, I noticed that they were the closest we had to a tabletop version of competitive Pokemon, and that inspired me to start working on this game. Over the years I spent working on it, it's changed form drastically multiple times as I tried to figure out how moveset customization would work, starting from being a Sakura Arms-style dueling game where you construct your card pool after looking at your opponent's options, to being a handbuilder, to being a Smash-Up style shuffle-builder, to being a deckbuilder, until finally I decided to just axe customization to get what we have now.

And I'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out. For one, it made playtesting/balancing much less of a nightmare, but it also makes it a breeze to setup and play. Half the setup is basically just choosing 3 Fighters and shuffling up your Poker deck, which makes it easy to just play like 10 games in a row, since there's so little downtime.

If you're interested in the game, please check out the website I set up for it, where you can find a sample print &amp; play and rules PDF.

I have a friend group we play weekly different board games. We are older guys, and most of us come together to have fun. However one of the guys takes it a bit too seriously in my opinion. When it seems that he is losing in a game he starts to berate others and whine. He also tends to carry grudges between games, even from events that happened weeks ago.   


For example goes all in on someone in the first round in a strategy game, just to knock out someone who had ""wronged"" him in a previous game, even when his move does not make sense.

boardgames,What I learned from 100 games of 7 Wonders (with Stats!),False,688,0,"TLDR:

Have you ever felt that a lot of strategic and tactical advice in board games is based on personal opinions that are not backed up by actual data? If the answer is yes, you are going to enjoy this read.

As a guy that loves stats, excel and board games, I dissect data from 100 games of 7Wonders (played over the course of the last 2 years) to back up arguments on some apparent contrarian opinions, which wonders seem to overperform and underperform, and the deeper implications on general strategy that this analysis suggests.

At the end of all this, 7Wonders remains a wonderful game that strikes a healthy mix between randomness and skill giving both first timers a fairly good shot at winning the game, and veteran players opportunities to stand out by carving out small edges at every turn.

But do not despair! There are still plenty of opportunities here to justify your loss at your gaming table because of some statistically underpowered wonder…

Link to all the data can be found here: [7Wonders Stats (100 games)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M0M3_MZKtMM6r0bk07wYEITEZOTK0vyDfiPb4wp_auE/edit?usp=sharing)

—--------------------------------------------------------

Back in 2019 I received 7 Wonders as a Christmas gift from my sister. She knew I was a big boardgame fan and that I have always been interested in ancient history, so she thought this game would be a perfect combination for me. As some here will probably relate, I am always a bit apprehensive when receiving boardgame presents from people that are not into the hobby, and I won’t lie, I was sceptical here too. Little did I know that a pandemic was about to come, and that this would become my most played game of the last two years..

As we started playing more often, I quickly acquired a few expansions, and once I integrated them into the core game, I started keeping track of our scores on an excel spreadsheet (see attached). Fast forward 2.5yrs, 31 friends and 100 games later, and this is the result.

All games recorded have been played with the same exact setup of core games + the following expansions:- 7 Wonders: Cities (includes Petra and Byzantium)- 7 Wonders: Cities Anniversary Pack (adds more Cities cards)- 7 Wonders: Wonder Pack (we used only The Great Wall and Stonehenge)

Why specifically only those? I like the base game the way it is, the only expansions I added were those that made it “more of the same”.

You can find a lot of guides online that share a lot of good strategies and ideas, but they all do it with only the core game in mind. As not everyone will be familiar of the characteristics with Cities, here is a heads up:

It stretches the core game by an extra turn – which means scores will be higher on average.- Cities cards work like Guild cards: there are a lot more of them in the pool than you play with in a single game, and you shuffle them inside the deck based on the number of players. This means that in a larger group, you will get to see a lot more Cities cards and have more opportunities to score points from them.- Cities cards do not have a single theme, but they have small thematic groups that align to all other card colors: better economy, coin losing cards, military boosts (both in points and shields), big point cards, extra Science cards.

The original idea behind collecting the stats was purely to answer one question: are all wonders built equally?

You can find plenty of analysis online of wonders that state “X is better than Y”, but they are all opinions for the most part, and they all analyze wonders in a vacuum based on their experience. What I can promise you here is that all of my arguments will be based on data. You might disagree with my findings, but we will all be discussing things from the same baseline.

**READERS BEWARE**: I’m well aware that 100 games are not really what a statistician would call a “statistically significant” number, nor does it follow rigorous statistical analysis. It is also going to be idiosyncratic to the way our group plays, and might not be representative of all tables. This is really just for the fun of seeing patterns in the data, speculate, and, most importantly, give you that much needed ammunition to complain at your table that you didn’t win because of some overpowered wonder…

Before we jump into the wonders analysis, I thought it might be interesting to look at some interesting insights from the data I collected. Here is my list.

# TOP 5 OBVIOUS FINDINGS:

1. **Yes, massive Science combos do win you games** – your win rate increases by a whopping 10.6% points above average when you score 25 or more Science points.
2. **But avoiding Science is fine too** – avoiding Science altogether does not have a significant impact on your win chances.
3. **And yes, Military blow outs also win you games** – similarly to Science, your win rate increases by 9.3% points when scoring 11 or more Military points.
4. **You are (sort of) right at choosing that B side** **(for the original wonders)**:
   1. A side (original 7 wonders): 20.8% winrate
   2. B side (original 7 wonders): 26.4% winrate
   3. That said, most A sides perform just fine and within average, with a couple of exceptions (Babylon and Rhodos)
5. **You can be (statistically) significantly better at this game than your friends** – as my friend proves, by not only winning well above expected, but also scoring on average much higher than any other player. Funny enough, when I asked them how they do it, they simply stated that they always focus on maximizing their own score, not preventing others from accessing good cards. It is not quite what you read on online articles, but it seems to be really effective at our table.

# TOP 5 SUPRISING FINDINGS:

1. **4 player games have the lowest points averages** – this might be due to the abundance of resource cards at 4 players (as highlighted by Red Proper[ here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/691370/some-complex-strategies-7-wonders)), or other card distributions. Just don’t be surprised when you play with 4 players and you have a low score and get away with a win.
2. **Economic cards are bad for you** – no matter which way you cut it, Economic points have a fairly apparent negative correlation to win rate (basically scoring any Economic points always lowers your win chances). On top of that, many wonders performance seem inversely correlated to how many Economic points/game they average. This is probably due to a combination of factors, including the fact that economic cards score poorly in the Third Age in particular. Also, anecdotally, our best player almost always stays away from them.
3. **Byzantium doesn’t suck** – in fact it holds a very respectable win rate with both side A and B. And, even though it is so far a small sample, it doesn’t seem to perform much worse at higher player counts (where you would intuitively assume its power becomes less effective).
4. **Stonehenge doesn’t suck either** – regardless of its apparent nonsensical Wonder stages point structure, Stonehenge does not seem to suffer particularly bad average points nor win rates. Solutions to fix this wonder seem unwarranted.
5. **Players really build affinity for certain wonders** – our best player won EVERY single time they played The Great Wall B, and 8 out of 9 times with The Great Wall overall. I got 50% winrate with both Giza and Halikarnassus, much higher than any other player. There are cases with other players as well.

Okay, back to the wonders. So, how do you determine if a wonder is good or not? After much deliberating, I settled for 2 key metrics:

|**Win Rate Performance**                                     (Win Rate above/below Expected Win Rate)|This metric subtracts the blend of your expected win rate (33% in a 3-player game, 25% in a 4-player game etc.) from your actual win rate. Positive means you win more often than you should, negative you win less often than you should.                                                             We will refer to this stat as “Win Rate Performance” for simplicity from now on.|
|:-|:-|
|**Points Performance**                                       (Average Points of the Player/Wonder above/below Average Points in a Game)|For each game I calculated the average (ex. hypothetical 3-player game of 60, 50 and 40  points would mean an average of 50) and calculated the delta from average in the game (so for the same game: +10, 0, -10). A positive average delta means that you consistently score above average, while a negative one means you consistently score below. This stat should be able to catch Wonders that perform well overall, but might have missed out on a few wins by small margins.                                                       We will refer to this stat as “**Points Performance**” for simplicity from now on.|

# THE OVERPOWERED WONDERS:

**The Great Wall B**

|Win Rate Performance|\+22.6%|Win Rate|Expected Win Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Points Performance|\+2.95 pts|45.5%|22.8%|

\# Games: 22

|When Loss|**58.7**|4.4|4.3|0.0|13.3|2.8|27.2|4.8|1.9|

Are you looking for a wonder to exclude from your games? Look no further than The Great Wall, with an almost 50-50 chance of winning the game when playing with the B side (although not on the same level, A side performs rather well too).

The Great Wall B side is the true standout performer among all wonders, topping every metric: highest win rate, highest average points per game, highest Win Rate Performance, highest Points Performance.

What makes The Great Wall B side so strong?

**Science, Science and more Science:** The obvious piece is that GW scores a whopping 35.9 points/game on science, the most of any wonder. The only other one that comes even close being the A side of GW. There are a trio of synergistic elements that make this happen:

\- Cloth starting resource on the board makes it easy to grab science early on.

\- Two wonder powers are linked to paper, another manufactured good. This further encourages grabbing paper early on, which makes you primed for an early science start.

\- In case you don’t get access to manufactured goods in the early rounds, stage 4 is the perfect counter – giving you any type of resource you don’t have to capture those precious science cards.

**Missing out on Military**: GW B is one of the lowest scorers on the board for military, but even more interesting is the fact that winners with GW B only score 1.5 points in Military (losers with GW B score 4.4 points on average in Military). It seems that players that lean on the wonder’s peace power are rewarded, but it also exemplifies another emergent theme: when you go heavy on science, you sacrifice the right opportunities to play military cards.

**Accumulate those coins:** Another, very surprising, point of note is that GW B has the highest points from coins than any other wonder (the only one averaging above 4 points/game), DESPITE scoring very low with economic cards. This is even more apparent when looking specifically only at GW B winners, who only score 0.8 points from economic cards on average. The Stage 1 power giving you 8 coins must have something to do with it, but GW A has a similar wonder stage and only manages 1.3 points/game from coins. This leads us back to the point about manufactured goods – you need few resources to get your engine going and can compensate for the missing ones with your Stage 4. This helps heavily reduce the number of coins you have to pay to your neighbours - which in turn potentially stifles their own chances of purchasing much-needed resources.

**Avoid Economic cards:** The low point score from Economic cards goes contrary to something I surely thought was the case: that 4 stage wonders (Giza and The Great Wall) are heavily favoured because of the Arena. GW B players, and winners in particular, very rarely benefit from building an arena as a way to capitalize on all 4 stages.

Looking at the average stats of all losers with GW B, we can also learn **how to defeat it**: block them out of Science cards, pushing them to lean into Military and Civilian structures.

One interesting point to note that is GW B is statistically significantly better than its A side cousin, contrary to much online tribal wisdom. This is exactly what I was hoping to achieve with this analysis, actually debating wonders using data instead of simply strategic opinions. I think this comes down to ease of build for wonder stages. Side A stages lack resource synergies and are quite expensive, while on side B you have 2 very clear routes to go: paper+wood, or stone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Halikarnassus B**

|Win Rate Performance|\+12.2%|Win Rate|Expected Win Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Points Performance|\+1.81 pts|34.8%|22.6%|

\# Games: 23

||Avg  Pts|Military|Coins/ Debt|Wonder|Civilian|Economic|Science|Guilds|Cities|

|Average|**62.7**|5.3|2.1|3.0|9.7|2.3|27.3|8.2|4.8|

|When Loss|**58.9**|6.6|2.6|3.0|8.7|2.9|22.9|6.9|5.3|

Halikarnassus B comes third both in Winrate Performance and Points Performance, suggesting it is a very consistent performer.

**Science (again)**: Hal B shares many characteristics with The Great Wall B: a very high Science scorer, while being a low Civilian, Economic and Military scorer. Hal B scores high on Science thanks to the following:

\- It starts with a manufactured good, giving it an early boost to Science.

\- Its power allows it to recover some science cards that might be discarded away, recovering on missed out opportunities, or potentially recovering a missing resources and manufactured goods necessary to build missing Science card trees.

**Forget about Civilian points:** Hal B is the lowest scorer of Civilian  points out of all wonders. This is something it has in common with GW B as well. But data suggests that Civilian cards strategies are not underpowered. I wonder if this is more of a lagging indicator: it might have to do with the fact that Civilian cards are always good points options when nothing else is available, and they very rarely end up in the discard pile, reducing chances for Hal B players to score points from them.

**Opportunistic Military:** However, interestingly enough, winners with Hal B score 3 points less on average in Military while scoring 3 points more on average with Civilian cards compared to those that lose with the wonder. It might mean that winners commit less cards to Military, managing to score just enough points from a discarded card, giving them more opportunities to secure points from elsewhere.

**Snatch those Guild cards:** Hal B winners score &gt;10 points/game with Guild cards and Hal B side scores 2 more points from Guild Cards than its side A cousin on average. Jury is still out as to whether we can make any statistically significant guesses from Guild cards without looking at the specifics of each game, but my educated guess would be that Hal B power makes it easy to grab extra resources, which means Hal B is rarely locked out of Guild cards and can capitalize on those opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

**Petra A**

|Win Rate Performance|\+5.3%|Win Rate|Expected Win Rate|

|When Loss|**58.9**|3.1|3.1|15.9|13.8|3.5|8.0|9.1|3.2|

Petra A’s winrate might make it an odd choice for most powerful wonder, but it has a surprisingly outstanding Points Performance: the only wonder other than The Great Wall B to average &gt;+2 points.

Do you remember all you learned about Halikarnassus and The Great Wall? Forget military, forget Civilian and go heavy Science? Well Petra A goes against ALL of that. This is what makes this game so interesting!

**High Wonder Stage Points**: Petra A’s biggest strength is (of course) its Wonder stages points. Not only Petra A scores the 2nd highest Wonder  points per game (16.2), but what makes it truly standout (and differentiate from its B side), is by how easily it can maximize its Wonder  points. Petra A players scored all 17 of their Wonder points in 17 out of 18 occasions. The Wonder  points give you a strong points base to build from with only 3 cards. No Petra A player ever scored less than 53 points in a game, the highest floor of any wonder.

**Flexible**: Looking at the overall average, it can be difficult to discern much else about Petra A. being middle of the road in most categories. However, this also suggests that it is a very flexible wonder that can be played many different ways.

**Red and Blue:** We can see some trends here. Winners with Petra A score a whopping 10.4 Military points/game on average. Petra A is perfect for this strategy: 2 of its Wonder stages requiring Stone and Wood, while providing you Clay as a starting resource. The perfect invitation to lean a Civilian + Military strategy, topped up with some nice 17 Wonder points.

**Combo with Cities Cards:** This strategy can be often complemented by some good Cities cards. Although random in nature, you are likely to find some that either boost Military (extra shields, extra points per Military Victory or even extra Military Victories altogether) or plain points (there are 2 separate heavy points structure trees). Petra A winners capitalize on this, scoring on average 4 more points from Cities cards than their losing counterparts. The cherry on top of the Wonder+Blue+Red strategy is Black.

# THE UNDERPOWERED WONDERS:

**Rhodos A**

|Win Rate Performance|\-12.5%|Win Rate|Expected Win Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Points Performance|\-2.21 pts|11.8%|24.3%|

\# Games: 17

||Avg  Pts|Military|Coins/ Debt|Wonder|Civilian|Economic|Science|Guilds|Cities|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Average|**57.8**|9.4|2.7|9.2|13.1|3.2|5.5|7.6|7.2|
|When Win|**65.0**|2.5|6.0|10.0|16.0|3.0|16.5|4.0|7.0|
|When Loss|**56.9**|10.3|2.3|9.1|12.7|3.3|4.0|8.1|7.2|

It is now time for the less fun part, the losing side of the coin. There were certainly some surprises, like Rhodos A, which boasts the worst winrate of any wonder, and is a strong runner for worst wonder overall.

I had to think really hard on this one, because there are many conflicting statistics. Does the fact that Rhodos A scores poorly (and Rhodos B not faring much better), while The Great Wall/Halikarnassos scoring highly without Military, mean that Military strategies suck? Statistics seem to indicate otherwise – across all wonders the average winner scores &gt;3 points/game more from Military than the average loser.

Maybe it has to do with the fact that Rhodos requires 4 ore resources to build a wonder stage, which is hard to get and easy to block? I thought this was a good lead, but I found out that the average player gets full wonder stage points 88% of the time, which is well within average across the board, and better than many wonders.

So, what’s wrong with Rhodos A?

**Feeling Blue**: it is a well-documented strategy that Military and Civilian go well together because they require much of the same resources. Yet, Rhodos A seems to struggle to capitalize on this synergy, scoring a very average 13.2 points/game from Civilian cards (Rhodos B on the other hand does the job really well with 19.2 points/game from Civilian, leading to much better win rates and average points/game).

**Wonder stages resource requirements**: yes I know I just said that 4 ores wasn’t a leading cause of weakness, but I think it is worth looking deeper at Rhodos A from a resource/reward perspective. As wiser people online have pointed out, the 2 shields bonus that Rhodos A gives you is only good if you also build Military cards to capitalize on it. But Rhodos’ stages have fairly high resource requirements: you need to get 2 woods, 3 clay and 4(3) ores. Clay is not a particularly useful resource for Civilian cards in the high amounts the wonder needs, and only 2 Military cards require more than 1 ore, and one of them needs stone. Furthermore, you will be excluded from some Military buildings without a hefty amount of stone, and you need at least access to all manufactured goods to capitalize on a palace, guilds and other powerful cards in the Third Age. That is a lot of resources you need access to for a Blue/Red strategy. It is true that wonders like Giza also require hefty resources, but they reward you with immediate points (can 2 shields give you &gt;5 points/game consistently?).

&amp;#x200B;

**Babylon A**

|Win Rate Performance|\-8.6%|Win Rate|Expected Win Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Points Performance|\-2.19 pts|13.3%|21.9%|

\# Games: 16

|When Loss|**58.3**|0.9|1.3|8.4|15.5|2.5|18.9|5.5|5.3|

You might be tempted to think that all the worst wonders would have in common a low scientific score, but Babylon A is here to prove otherwise. Babylon A is another case of a Wonder side that typically online is considered stronger than its B side counterpart, but that stats prove otherwise.

**Coins and Resources struggles**: one of the most atypical aspects of this wonder is that it is designed with Science in mind, but starts without a manufactured good. Starting with Clay means that you need more turns to get your Science engine firing and, unless extremely lucky, you end up paying at least once for a manufactured good from a neighbour to get a precious Science card in the First Age. This often creates a vicious cycle of starting the Second Age low in coins, forcing you into Economic cards to boost your income first, and potentially missing out on some of the best cards in the first hand of the Second Age without the necessary coins to access your neighbours’ resources. This is why Babylon A’s average Science score/game (22.2) is high, but much lower than Science powerhouses The Great Wall B (35.9) and Halikarnassos B (27.3), and why it is not enough to compensate for missing out on points in other areas. This is further validated by Babylon A’s lowest score from Coins in the game (1.3 points/game on average) – it seems that to go for the Science strategy you need to spend a lot of coins.

**Science over Military**: do you remember our discussion for Halikarnassos? Same applies here – trying to go heavy Science sacrifices Military structures. Babylon is the 2nd lowest scorer for average Military points/game (0.5), after Byzantium A, which is a wonder that pushes you into avoiding conflict altogether!

**Those damn Guilds**: Babylon A has another really low score area, which it shares with Petra B – very low average Guild card scores. A high guild score does not necessarily make you a winner, but it seems that those resource and economic struggles at the beginning limit your ability to get your hands on key guild cards in the Third Age.

|When Loss|**54.4**|4.4|2.5|15.1|17.3|4.6|1.9|3.7|4.9|

Petra B is the a really tough wonder to play with. No other wonder has a bigger difference between their A side and their B side than Petra. But why does Petra B suck so much when Petra A doesn’t?

**14 Coins!**: Accumulating 14 coins to score 14 points is a much more daunting task than 7 coins for 7 points of it’s A side. While accumulating 7 coins might be something a resource heavy strategy would naturally lean into (by virtue of your neighbours buying resources from you), getting to 14 coins requires you to plan for it. A plan that needs to counteract Cities cards, many of which cause players to lose coins, further hurting Petra B.

**Economic cards**: so what does the Petra player do to catch up on coins? Play a lot of economic cards, the only one with a fairly negative correlation to win rate. By playing economic cards, especially in the second and third age as they are trying to catch up on the coins they need to build their last wonder stage, Petra B loses on many opportunities to make big strategic commitments (like Science). This is why Petra B players have the lowest average Science score overall (1.7 points/game), and the highest average Economic score (5.2 points/game).

**Guild cards**: The third piece I had not quite noticed before is that Petra B players also significantly miss out on Guild  points. Petra B has the lowest  points/game from Guild cards (3.6), with only 40% of Petra B players scoring any Guild points, compared to \~70% of players in the average game across all wonders. And while Guild cards are not necessary to win, Petra B often arrives in the Third Age with too many things yet to do (accumulate coins, build wonder, not missing out on high points Civilian cards), hurting its chances at snatching good Guild cards.

# FINAL THOUGHTS:

After spending hours looking at the game statistics, it’s disappointing to know that, even with all this knowledge and time spent analyzing this game, I am not even the best player at my table.

All that effort was not in vain however, as I was able dissect the different wonders with as little bias as possible. Often online guides rely on a simple explanation of the wonder stages in a vacuum, which appear reasonable but often do not hold up to statistical scrutiny: Stonehenge might appear nonsensical, yet it scores perfectly fine and has a good win rate. The Great Wall A might appear a better side, yet the B side is so much better statistically. And the A side of the original 7 wonders is somewhat weaker only in the Babylon and Rhodos cases, while the others hold up just fine with their B side counterparts.

As I spent more and more time looking at the data, I was surprised that I started paying more attention to the resource costs of wonder stages instead of their powers. Certain wonders just seem primed to synergize well with resources, while others don’t. Nothing shows this contrast more than The Great Wall and Petra, both with similar powers on each side, yet with a blatantly more useful side than the other. You might see me again in the future dropping another article on some additional 7 wonders theorycrafting - especially if I can convince my friends to play another hundred or more games!

Like many eternally good board and card games, 7 Wonders has a fine balance of randomness and depth, where a player on their first couple of games is able to take home a win with a bit of luck, but also where a good player can consistently outperform their opponents. Finding that balance is hard, but when you do, you have a game that can be fun for friends and relatives that only play once a year, as well as entertain those, like me,  that want to dive really deep into the game.

I have shared the link to my data in the hope that actual statisticians will be able to play with it and reveal other interesting trends. All I ask of in return is to post the interesting findings you will find. I have left tables from my analysis in the sheet, some more useful than others, for those that are interested and want to deep dive into the data.

There are always new shiny games ready to steal away your time and attention, and it is unlikely that I will again have the chance to dedicate so much time to a single board game. However, 7 Wonders will remain an eternally enjoyable game that will continue to hit my table every time we have too many players for anything else, or when someone is secretly looking to improve their statistics…",,120,,688,,public

boardgames,"Magic words required: I want to sell a game my wife absolutely hates, but she wants to keep.",False,52,0,"The game in question is SCYTHE. We mostly play cooperative games because she is extremely conflict sensitive, but agreed to give this a shot because of the art and my hype about it. This was last Christmas, where we got the game as a gift from my mom.

Our experience, despite houserules of not attacking / stealing from each other (which arguably gutted the game as tension, even without action, is a huge part of it), is abysmal. Every single time we played across this almost 1 year, she lost. She doesn't even want to know her score for some time now, which makes me not want to care about... Any of it, all of it! What's the point of a conpetitive game where you compare points if the other player doesn't want her points counted and compared? Then it was annoyance that the game ends when I reach 6 stars, and that her plans are left unfinished. Sure, do that, we keep playing. We finish it when she had 6 stars too, in the meantime I suffered through stacking money, won, and it was just as bad all the same.

We tried to play it with extended family as group of 5. She is somewhere in the middle by the end, but doesn't want her points counted. I win with 3 stars and 90 points, extended family while had fun, score 70-20. They like tge game, they don't mind losing because they are like me, they enjoy losing as long as they learn, improve, and feel smarter after every game. She cannot be like that when she is facing other players.

She hates all of it from her guts, and because of that, I developed a very strong distain, even disgust of the thought of putting on the desk.

Before I get relationship advices, her happiness is the most important to me, and I avoid suggesting SCYTHE. But she does put it on the table, I know she does it from a sense of guilt, the she made me hate it, something I was very happy about the ""honeymoon phase"", something my mom gifted us/me. 

I explained to her in detail, that boardgames are an activity we share, playing by definition is having fun doing something we enjoy and getting better at it or being comfortable where we are. Our experience differs with this game so much, that even if I used to like it, I hate to see her being miserable and I would prefer to play anything else instead, including our many coop games (she is a freaking master of Spirit Island! ♥️). It's okay to feel the way she feels about the experience she had, and I don't blame her or hold her responsible or resent her. We tried, on her request more than mine, to make it work and it does not work for us, and that's okay. That's why I want to sell it, because it just catches dust otherwise, and we could invest that money into games / expansions she likes, that we like. 

Nope, don't sell it! She made an incredibly pretty, printed on think paper, colored insert. A huge setvof boxes found on bgg files, and spent 5 hours cutting and gluing them. So we played again. And she is miserable, again. My distain towards the game is through the roof. Her sense of guilt, no matter what I say, is through the roof. Regarding extended family, they like SCYTHE, but not enough to not play something we are having more fun with (Terraforming Mars, Bang dice, Meadow, Last Bastion, Pandemic Rome, the list goes on), and honestly I don't care about if they'll miss it or not, I care about my wife's feelings first. 

How the hell do I get her to understand the issue here is not her, and that we should reforge (by selling) the game into something we like? Her dedication to me is lovely, but in this particular case, very unhealthy I think, and I cannot say this at the same time with ""it's not your fault"", because she keeps mixing these things as if saying this is paradoxical.",,112,,52,,public
boardgames,"Played Root for the first time Saturday, loved it so much we played 3 straight games.

I’d love to just talk about Root, any tips or things you love about the game. But I also have a few rule questions: 

1. When crafting, does the suit of the card matter for anything? Or just having the crafting building matching the suit in the bottom left? 

2. Can the Vagabond not craft the cards with 3 different suits on them? 

3. Do Alliance bases count as sympathetic clearings? 

4. The cats’ “March” ability: so March means you can make 2 moves. can you move to one clearing, pick up the warriors there and move the whole new group to the second clearing? Can you split the moves between two groups?

boardgames,Review of King’s Dilemma,False,4,0,"Let me preface this review by saying we just finished our 16th and final round of KD and I was the overall winner of the legacy game.

Going into this game, my expectations were that I was sitting on the small council like in Game of Thrones and I would have a lot of meaningful choices to affect the game. This unfortunately was nowhere near the result. As with any legacy game, I don’t like to look into the game TOO much incase I catch a spoiler so I probably could have watched some spoiler free videos to prepare myself first.

The good: I like having my own faction which I keep throughout the whole legacy. I think this is key to a good legacy. I also very much enjoyed the ending (which I won’t mention obviously). The artwork on the cards was also cool. The map that comes with the game is also cool.

The bad: the physical board is dull and a bit of a turnoff. You spend ~$100 on a game that has no miniatures and finite uses, I expect there to be a big map with pieces or a really cool board. This board looks like it was straight out of a prototype. While this may be a “good” for some people… but for me, this next point is a bad. The player who was doing the absolute worst in the game ended up with 2nd place based on how our game went in the endgame. There didn’t seem to be much of a payoff for me who entered the endgame as the clear leader compared to the player who entered having only won a single game. Seems a bit off to me.

The ugly: the rule book is BAD. I would say my group is pretty intermediate to heavy gamers and the rule book is horrific. They may as well not include it and make you guess the rules in some areas of the game. 

Overall: this game as a legacy game is about a 5/10 for me. In comparison, I would say Pandemic season 1 is a 10, Risk Legacy is a 1, and Scythe Legacy is about a 7-8.

Buy this legacy game with low expectations and you may get something out of it.",,15,,4,,public

This is the only game she wants to play, and she wants to play it over and over during every visit. 

Now, I like Bananagrams. But it has become too much. I need another word game to put in the mix. Growing up, she played Scrabble with us but not much else. She likes games that are rules lite and fairly quick - I've tried introducing a lot of other games along those lines (original Tsuro, Qwirkle, etc) but I have a feeling that the only game that can dethrone THE BANANA is another word game. 

I bought and played Letter Tycoon recently (and enjoy it) but I can't find another copy for sale online (I got the only copy at my flgs and it seems out of stock on the manufacturer's website) and while I'm planning on taking it home at Christmas, I *really* wanted to get one to leave there. 

THINGS I THINK SHE LIKES ABOUT BANANAGRAMS

Easy setup

Receiving letters and spelling words as a mechanic

Quick gameplay

Short game duration 

Simple rules

Rewards having a good vocabulary

Portable

boardgames,Just finished The King’s Dilemma. What next?,False,32,0,"I just finished The King’s Dilemma and loved it. The light roleplaying, interesting story and simple game mechanics really sold me.

I played with 4 others and I’d love a new story focused game to play with them. A lot of the similar games in BGG seem to be max 4 players. Even better if it’s a campaign. 

I have Mansions of Madness, Journeys of Middle Earth and Forgotten Waters. I enjoy all of these but I really like the more political negotiating aspect to The King’s Dilemma. 

What would you recommend next?",,13,,32,,public

##FAQ

**I live in Barbados/Canada/Guatemala/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now I cnat spel amymor!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on hope and dreams, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

##Changes since last week

* Added tag for Gamefound's Stable Pledge program (🔄).

##Edit

Ugh, mental note: Editing a post removes all non-breaking spaces and screws up formatting.

boardgames,Painted models from the Waddingtons 1996 version of Cludeo,False,14,0,"Recently I managed to find an old copy of Waddingtons Cludeo.

This particular version of the game really means a lot to me as I have very fond memories of playing this with my brother and cousins when we were younger. One thing that amazed me when I found it was that is was made in my hometown.

Naturally when I got this nostalgic gem, I just had to paint the minis.  
Personally I always felt this version of the game had the best models, though my partner believes the one she grew up with is better... naturally.

Do other people have a particular version of Cludeo they prefer, or any other game.  
Personally I feel a lot of the modern versions of these iconic games lack their old charm.

boardgames,Aesthetic Storage Solutions assistance,False,6,0,"I have several games (as do we all) that have been expanded upon. Storage is becoming an issue. I want to keep each game entirely in one box, but that has become challenging. Additionally, storing games in generic boxes is very unappealing to me, something I learned when I started pulling apart my small card games and putting them in clear storage bins. The games in question are:

* Dixit (currently in three thin/tall boxes)
* Firefly the game (current in a clear bin)
* Apples to Apples (currently in a clear bin)
* Elder Sign (overstuffed into original box, with two expansions in their own boxes)
* Terraforming Mars (overstuffed into the original box)

I know Terraforming Mars has the Big Box Kickstarter expansion, something I missed out on, so that's on my list and a planned purchase. I've looked into Broken Token boxes, particularly for Firefly, which I like, but they still lack in regards to me wanting to artfully display the games on my shelves.

Incrementally increasing your capacity and city-building in a balanced way gets you a ton of cash, but it hurts you in the end since you wind up constrained in your ability to power enough cities to compete in the final round. 

You’re instead rewarded for overextending yourself on power plant capacity and then playing a massive building play to trigger the endgame at everyone else’s expense.

boardgames,[COMC] Finished the basement and built a gaming area.,False,311,0,"First and last COMC. I've been in the hobby since 2009.

Last piece of trim went up yesterday, and I thought if I were ever going to share this type of post, this would be the only time. I tried to make the post worthwhile and gave various info. I made a lot of custom stuff in the collection, including storage solutions, a gaming table, terrain, Crokinole board(s), and various other things.[link to game room album](https://imgur.com/a/GpsCxHs)

[edit] the table had my custom blood bowl pitch set up on it for the photo 

# The Project

We live in Wisconsin and went remote full time at the start of the pandemic. At that time none of my basement was finished, and working in a dungeon-like space during the winter months was pretty depressing. To top it off we locked down pretty hard, so I needed something to get me through the January-April months of being locked up inside. So I began finishing the 1200 or so square feet of my house. I did all the wiring, lighting, sheetrock, taping, mudding, painting, floors and finish work: all of it. I wanted a bright, warm feel to the basement where I now spend most of my time. The rest of the space not shown has a pool table and open area for playing room scale VR. Then my office space, workout area and art studio corner. It's all an open room with the posts down the middle.

# Custom made stuff

I posted a few things in the past so here's the info and links.

[Gaming table (not shown)](http://imgur.com/gallery/qsgw0) It's in our dining room and staying there

On the table is my [custom made Blood Bowl pitch](https://imgur.com/a/KSFP5) for the wood elf team ""The Mean Prey Trackers"".

I also make crokinole boards. [Link to a previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/geom55/covid_crokinole_boards_a_diy_report/) And I made a matching carrom board as well.

I designed the banners on the wall. The first has the logo for the league I run, and the other for my team. Printed on vinyl.

# Game Collection info

I used to run a weekly game night and had been doing that for about seven years, but COVID killed it. Consequently my game collection has gone through a bit of turnover. I eliminated some games that just weren't going to get played anymore and picked up more family/casual and ""evergreen"" or ""classic hobby"" games as well as some good soloable titles.

I've condensed the expansions down into one box as much as possible. If a game on the shelf has an expansion it's likely in there.

I tried to arrange the games by shelf, but it's not a perfect system as you fill one and have space elsewhere.

Not shown: Catan, a few smaller games like The Crew, and my painted miniatures cabinet. I have all released blood bowl teams, and I think I'm 3 teams behind in assembling and painting, so I'm doing pretty good with the painting backlog. I also play Marvel Crisis Protocol and pick up most of those releases. Also doing fairly well keeping up on the backlog there.

# Shelves:

Top shelf is basically the heavier or solo games.

Second from the top has most of the family weight, casual games

Third shelf down has more of the ""next step"" middle weight games as well as a few lighter titles

Fourth shelf has the odd box sizes and some random stuff. The one with a lock printed on it is Kingdom Rush. Mechs vs Minions (all painted) and Hoplomachus are obscured in the photo.

bottom shelf: To cull pile and random stuff. A few Magic Commander decks and some pre-built Netrunner decks I assembled.

Floor: Pitch Car tub filled to the brim. A few custom made pieces like my own loop and such.

# Kallax

travel bag on top to carry blood bowl or Marvel minis.

Tube has my custom printed vinyl blood bowl pitches

Batman Gotham City Chronicles: I know it's divisive, but we love it. I have all of the villains painted so far. This game was heading towards the cull list, but the third season has a solo option coming that has kept it on the shelf.

Full collection of Marvel Champions in dividers (hero cards) and encounter cards (card box).

Full Lord of the Rings LCG arranged the same way

Full Netrunner collection: I only bought a few releases for that game, but they made the cards public. I was able to print them for free at my brother's print shop, so it cost me about $100 in sleeves to get the entire collection.

Blood Bowl pitches and rule books

Next to Gloomhaven is my dicemasters storage solution. Each tray pulls out. Dice are arranged at an angle in rows. Dicemasters is probably leaving the collection, tho.

# My personal top ten:

1. Blood Bowl
2. Star Wars Rebellion - would be #1 if I played it as much as Blood Bowl.
3. Gloomhaven
4. A Feast for Odin - purchased in the last year. Rocketed to the top 5. So good.
5. Spirit Island
6. Great Western Trail
7. Lord of the Rings LCG
8. Merchants and Marauders
9. Roll Player
10. Marvel Champions

# Most played:

Lord of the Rings, LCG by a mile

Blood Bowl

Marvel Champions

Gloomhaven

Just One

Codenames

# To cull list:

Paper Dungeons: didn't hit for me

Fallout: I picked up the solo expansion but it's just not a game I wanna pull off the shelf

King of New York

Dice Town

Twilight Struggle: (I know I know, but it's just not being played)

# The culled games of days gone by that were complete purchase mistakes:

Age of Conan: what a slog. Had some weird stuff going on.

B-29 Superfortress: nope, not a war gamer

Charterstone: didn't land at all for us

First martians: hated it. There's something better about Robinson Crusoe's building up vs First Martians damage control.

Kingsburg: found it completely boring

Mansions of Madness 2nd edition: the shine wore off so quickly.

Myth: terrible game

Return of the Heroes: outdated

Rising Sun: hated the bidding mechanic

Space Infantry: not my thing

7th continent: I hated the rinse/repeat do everything again thing

Tainted Grail: OMG the story was great but the game part was such a chore.

boardgames,Thoughts on Red Cathedral?,False,5,0,"I've only played this twice, and enjoyed it both times, but the owner has a strategy which won, but threatened to slow the game down if everyone did it. They only built decorations until they had enough eagle points to make building the actual cathedral worthwhile. If everyone did this there'd be a stalemate drawing out the game, but they won handily with this approach, so I'm not sure what the solution is.

Is this an issue, or do the rest of us just need to up our game?

boardgames,"After a year of playtesting, I just released my own card game: Cat and Mouse! Come check it out.",False,12,0,"[**Cat and Mouse** on itch.io](https://leonegaming.itch.io/cat-and-mouse)

*Players: 2*  
*Time: 15-30 minutes*  
*Ages: 7+*  
*Requires a standard 52-card deck of cards*

This is a cutthroat, two-player, asymmetric card game where one player plays an aggressive Cat and the other plays a sneaky Mouse. It doesn't take long to play, it's quick to learn, and the rules are free to download (although donations are of course appreciated if you enjoy it).

I've playtested Cat and Mouse with a lot of people; it's clearly not for everyone, but people who enjoy a competitive, take-that-style of play that includes trying to deceive your opponent generally enjoy playing. If that sounds like you, check it out! :)

boardgames,Has anyone tried to control for weight in BGG rating's?,False,107,0,"A bit of a technical question/complaint came up when my wife and I were looking at getting 5 or 6 games from our LFGS that was doing a sale.  We wanted a mix of games for the two of us, games for boardgame nights and games that our five year old might be able to play with us. In looking at BGG ratings there was a really obvious correlation between the game weight rating and the overall score. 

Now, of course, with a website called board game GEEKs, that shouldn't be surprising. However, it did just raise the question and I wondered if anyone had tried to look into it and home up with a rule of thumb correction or anything like that?",,52,,107,,public
boardgames,Contract rummy version,False,4,0,"Years ago my husband and I played what I now realize is a form of contract rummy.  This was at a friend's place, and they laughingly called it an old folks game (none of us were exactly spring chickens).  The difference in this game was that they had a regular deck of 52 cards that someone had placed stickers on each with a contract.  You'd shuffle that deck and turn over a card then have to play to achieve the contract displayed with a normal deck.  As far as I remember, the whole deck had these stickers.  
I have looked for rules/contracts  for anything similar and have come up empty-handed.  Most contract rummy games only have 10-14 contracts.  Anyone ever play anything like this or have one of these decks?  I'd just like to know the contracts as I could easily create my own deck.",,0,,4,,public

boardgames,Board game design: when is history too much?,False,5,0,"Hey y’all I’m designing my second board game and i want to set it in colonial period Georgia, Alabama and Florida. You can play as the French, English, or Spanish colonial governor or the micco of the Creek Confederation. It’s a game of resource management and diplomacy, where you will trade and make alliances w smaller American Indian nations to gain an advantage. It’s inspired by the real history of the Southeast, which did involve a complex wheeling and dealing between colonial and indigenous powers.

My question is where do you draw the line on what’s appropriate in a historical game?
Slave raiding and slave revolts were a huge part of the diplomatic and economic interchange of the groups in the game. I kind of want to make slaves or captives an in-game resource and give players a reason to conduct slave raids or arm slave revolts against each other like in real life. The problem is that i worry that people wont be comfortable using slaves as a resource in the game. Maybe it shouldn’t be comfortable 🤷🏻‍♂️ i dont want to whitewash what really happened. I think there should also be an option for a colonial player to wipe out a small tribe like they really did, but again is that too horrible to make it part of the game? Obviously you could choose not to, or to abolish slavery with certain tradeoffs, but is it a problem for it to just be possible?
The game is meant to teach about a dark part of history, but I don’t want it to offend or disgust people. I havent heard anyone complaining that you have to play as nazis in Axis and Allies, though. Where do you think the line should be drawn between historical accuracy and modern players’ sensibilities?",,34,,5,,public

Description: 

Size is Standard(65*88mm iirc)

Front is clear, glossy and smooth

Back is just a hint of matte/opaqueness, bears the iconic hologram of Ultra Pro and has a slightly rough feeling

Shuffling is very statisfying and easy

I recently bought Undaunted Normandy and North Africa, used. While the latter was still in wrap, Normandy was already sleeved. 
Alas, the seller cant remember which sleeves he used. Told me it's Mayday Premium but a friend reminded me that the little hologram dot on the back means they are Ultra Pro. 
We cant figure out which of their ~367 different styles of sleeves these are, though

boardgames,Essen 2021 - how did the games I bought there fare?,False,99,0,"Essen 2021 – a haul retrospective

2021 was my first Essen, and I think we can all agree that new people are more prone to excess that those who have been around the block a few times – enter your kind narrator. Given that it was my first Essen, I felt that I had to buy all the games that looked good or otherwise fear that I would never again be able to find them. The FOMO really got to me. Luckily I’ve now seen that not to be the case at all (not even the promos were exclusive to Essen!), meaning that I can go to Essen 2022 with a noticeably lower desire to acquire. However, I thought it might be fun to take a look at the games I bought at Essen 2021 and see how well they fared in my collection. 
For this, I’ll be talking about the games I’ve bought, the number of plays they each had and my reviews in brief. Should you be curious about specific games, feel free to drop a comment. 

**Art Robbery** – 10 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Art Robbery is one of the filler-type games that gets the most play around my house. I’ve got the teach down to a slim two minutes, and I’ve also got the soundtrack down pat. It really is quite Knizia. I still stand by most of the stuff I’ve said in my review, except for the fact that I have had some games of this that were not fun for everyone. I’m A-ok with people consistently stealing my stuff, because I find it hilarious and the game will be over in ten minutes anyway. However, I have had games where people are consistently frustrated that they don’t draw cards that let them do anything they feel is meaningful while consistently getting their stuff stolen. Touch with caution. 

**Golem** - 5 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! I wrote a long piece where I analyzed the cultural history in this game, and I stand by most of what I said there. That said, I have encountered some real problems that stop me from getting it to the table more. The teach is an absolute BEAR, mostly because the game is such an icon soup. I’m also finding that the core gameplay loop is becoming less and less satisfying the more times I play it, because there’s such little interaction. I can see this getting the axe in the future. 

**LUNA Capital**- 5 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! I bought this game mostly because a number of YouTube people were raving about it and I found the artwork cute, but I ended up not liking the core gameplay that much. The tile tower is fiddly, even though you would expect that not to matter that much, and the stuff with the cards… I would just rather be playing Azul, which I feel covers much the same ground while being a lot more streamlined and transparent. Bit of a dud for me, this one. 

**MicroMacro Crime City – full house** - 1 play  
Do I still own it: I do! Mostly because we haven’t really gotten around to playing this one much. I really like MicroMacro though, so I’m just saving this one for a rainy day. I like the little quality of life improvements for families now that they have added little icons that indicate what type of case you can expect, as it helps parents who want to play together with their kids make more educated choices of what type of content they want to expose their kids to. 

**Mindbug** - 4 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! It ended up being too thin for me. The main draw of this game was that it was kind of like squeezing all the water and fat out of Magic the Gathering, ending up with this super sleek game that could be taught and played in mere minutes. For me though, the end result was a game that just didn’t really do much for me. It felt a little bland, like some soul was missing. A soul that can’t be plastered over by any kind of goofy artwork. 

**MOON ADVENTURE** - 7 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! I did really like Moon Adventure, but I just don’t really play that many cooperative games. This one in particular felt really hard to do well, as the Ion Storms can just absolutely mess you up even though you’ve been very careful. I like the core system (which is why I do still own Deepsea Adventure), but this cooperative take did not end up setting my world on fire. 

**Railroad Ink Challenge – Lush Green** - 6 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! I really like this one! Railroad Ink is always nice and mindful, and I’m pretty much always satisfied with the end result. There’s just something very soothing about making a little train route, even though this one does a good job of putting on the pressure more. I personally prefer the trails expansion over the trees expansion, even though both are good. This is also the version of Railroad Ink Challenge that I recommend people get. It’s a good game! 

**SCOUT** - 4 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Scout is just a great, great, great little game, as you may have been told over the last few months. The cardplay feels really fun, I like the theme well enough (my SO and I made it a tradition to tell the other players the names of the cards we’ve played) and there’s something unique about the cards in this game. Recommended, assuming there will be a time where you can actually acquire it. 

**The Siege of Runedar** - 6 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! The Siege of Runedar was REALLY FUN while it lasted though. I didn’t end up falling in love with the core system, and the lack of variability (besides difficulty) ended up killing the game for me. Each game played much too similarly, which ended up with me using the same strategies over and over again. I had my fun exploring the system, so now it’s time to pass it onto someone else. 

**Whitehall Mysteries** - 3 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Whitehall Mysteries, to me, is just the strictly superior version of the Letters to Whitechapel system. It’s lean, it’s easy to understand, it’s quick, it’s incredibly tense; I really do love it a lot. It is currently my favourite hidden movement game, although I’ve heard good things about Sniper Elite and MIND MGMT. I’ve got Beast underway from Kickstarter sometime before December, we’ll wait and see if that game can claim the title. As it stands though, Whitehall Mysteries really is what I love about the system as a whole. It’s tense, excruciating turns followed either by having the cops on your heels or feeling like you’re a criminal mastermind. I cannot recommend this game enough, even though I realize that it is quite difficult to get at the moment.   

**FINAL SCORE**  
Games bought: 10  
Games still in collection: 6  

Not a bad score actually! There’s some games on here that I’m a little salty about (mostly LUNA Capitol) and one that I can see leaving in the not-so-distant future (Golem), but as it stands I do feel that this is a pretty good score. Having said that, I do feel it important to again emphasize (to myself as much as others, to be honest) that Essen should not only be about acquiring new games but also about simply playing and enjoying the con. Last year I went by myself; this year I will be going together with three of my friends. I cannot wait to share this whole new experience with them.  

**BONUS** - my top 5 games I’m excited about this year.  
1. Tribes of the Wind  
2. Deal With the Devil  
3. Heat  
4. Ready, Set, Bet!  
5. 1998 ISS

boardgames,"Diaries of a Board Game Designer: Part 4 - Global Fulfillment, VAT, and how we became EU friendly for our KS campaign",False,30,0,"Hey!

Today I want to talk about **logistics and fulfillment**. This is a large area with particular importance to our backers as it decides whether the games will reach them economically, in good time and in one piece. This was one of the first things we decided to tackle when we started this project and we made a poor choice at first when working through the issues.

To set the scene, we anticipate:

* Our backers will be primarily based in the USA
* Approximately 20-25% of backers will be European/ UK
* Any Oceania based backers we will be able to send directly from our homes in Australia

Initially we did minimal research and met with logistics/ fulfillment partners that were aligned with manufacturers we were talking to based in the USA. Whilst the people at these logistics partners were very helpful to establish some initial thought processes, they were missing key factors that we were not yet aware of. Initially, we selected a provider that we weren’t aware had a less than stellar reputation due to their helpfulness in establishing initial thought processes. What we didn’t realise was that the cost of their service and their reputation for helping our customers was not peak industry standard as we had been searching for. Additionally, they were presenting a USA based only strategy which would mean very expensive fulfillment for our European backers when VAT and higher shipping fees from the USA are taken into account. Ultimately, what we thought would be helpful advice turned out to be more of a sales pitch, perhaps a bit naive from us to expect anything else but the tone of communication presented more friendly than business. 

When we realised our mistake we had to restart the process of choosing a fulfillment provider or providers that were recognised as industry leaders in service and would deliver our games in a good state to our backers. Over the last couple years there has been a huge amount of movement in this industry due to COVID and the war in Ukraine which has made it very difficult to find up to date information.

**USA &amp; NA Fulfillment** 

USA &amp; Canadian fulfillment is a much simpler process than many other places in the world as the import charges are easier to deal with and assistance is readily available from the fulfillment providers. Fulfillment in the US is a highly competitive market with many companies to choose from. Shipping charges are well established, competitive and turnaround times are relatively quick. There are a few providers that are commonly referred to as industry leaders for the Kickstarter space across various articles we found online, in particular Fulfillrite and Quartermaster Logistics. We spoke to both companies and chose to go with Fulfillrite based on the response times we received to our queries, however both companies are very knowledgeable and helpful. Both companies also provided quotes to fulfill games worldwide, however the pricing is far greater than local fulfillment and we therefore chose to split fulfillment with a EU based provider and completing Oceanic fulfillment ourselves. 

**UK &amp; EU Fulfillment**

In particular there has been significant changes to the way VAT is dealt with for imported goods. In order to ensure we were across the recently changed VAT processes for imported goods in the EU we conducted a significant amount of research before contacting EU based fulfillment providers. In particular the Stonemaier games articles, whilst now out of date, provided an excellent starting point for this. I’ll link them below:

https://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter-lesson-47-this-project-is-eu-friendly/ 

Upon contacting our chosen European fulfillment partner they provided us with some extremely useful information in relation to the requirements for VAT on Kickstarter fulfillment for creators outside the EU, in particular for fulfillment from the UK. Below is the key passage as I had difficulty finding this information up-to-date elsewhere. 

*VAT in the UK: The UK now requires all publishers outside of the UK who are making sales to UK backers to become VAT registered in the UK, charge the appropriate VAT at point of Sale, then report this back to HMRC on a quarterly basis. You will also be required to obtain a UK EORI (Economic Operators Registration and Identification) Number to allow import into the UK. VAT registration in the UK is relatively simple with your application and quarterly reporting all being made online through the government gateway platform. There is no cost associated with registration or filing.

VAT in the EU: The EU also requires the charging of VAT at point of sale to all customers in the EU at the applicable regional rates.

A new system has been introduced to assist publishers with the collection and reporting of this VAT known as IOSS (Import One Stop Shop) – Under this system you are required to register and report your Sales VAT for all orders under 150EUR on a monthly basis. This registration will then allow you to send parcels from the UK to EU with no additional customs charges at the border. Shipments over 150EUR Value will be required to ship via a DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) service with the Sales VAT paid at the border by the courier directly and charged back to you.*

The EU Registration for IOSS is unfortunately more complicated than for the UK and requires fiscal representation in the EU to complete and provide your monthly filing, this does work out to be quite expensive.

Luckily, many fulfillment providers are now offering a service to submit EU VAT returns on creators behalf so that EU VAT registration is not required. This means that the VAT registration fees that would usually be required to be maintained to transact in Europe are able to be covered by the fulfillment provider. In the case of UK shipments, VAT declarations are required to be undertaken to HRMC quarterly by the seller (in this case, us), however there is no cost associated with this unless VAT has been collected in that quarter. In our case this made EU friendly fulfillment a reality, as the costs and processes to establish an EU entity and register for EU VAT would otherwise be prohibitive for our margin. 

**How do I become EU friendly and what does that even mean?**

EU friendly shipping means that packages in EU are delivered on a DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) basis. VAT &amp; import charges are collected prior to the package being sent to the purchaser and remitted on their behalf so that these changes are not required to be settled in order to receive the package on their end. This requires either:

* Registering for VAT in your own right, which comes with a monthly registration fee and likely accountants fees to arrange remittance of these charges
* Arranging for someone else to emit these charges on your behalf (if possible)

In our case, as described above, our UK &amp; EU fulfillment partner is arranging for the remittance of these charges on behalf of our backers. 

Often the phrase EU friendly shipping is associated with shipping from an EU location to limit the shipping expense, whilst this isn’t actually included in the original definition it will likely be required in order to properly deal with VAT on an EU friendly basis, as is the case with our campaign. 

**Our key learnings**

* The providers in this space are the best place to get current information. Whilst there is a bit of irony in me saying this in a post sharing our experiences, the logistics and fulfillment industry changes very rapidly and articles online quickly become out of date. Contacting providers directly gave us a far better picture than trying to research purely online, in particular providers we found that had a good reputation with other board game publishers. 
* Even though the fulfillment cost is largely borne by the backers, it’s still a significant gate in whether they will back the game and needs to be treated with respect. Our initially chosen provider would have meant that the cost of our game to backers outside the US would be roughly double, with the cost of shipping being almost as much as the game for EU based backers. This potentially would be a blocker for 20-25% of our backers who are anticipated to be outside the US, ultimately affecting our profitability due to potentially decreased manufacturing numbers. 
* Despite first impressions, including EU based fulfillment is actually an economically viable option. It felt easy at the start to write off EU based fulfillment due to the complexities, but working through the issues will help us run a successful (hopefully!) campaign.

I played Sekigahara and  had a blast, what a great game! But it's out of print everywhere. I signed up for the fifth print in GMT's P500, but who knows when the game will be finally released.  


And searching a little I discovered this other game called Granada: Last Stand of the Moors, that is a spiritual sucessor of Sekigahara, great art and basically  the same rules with a few additions like ships etc... I'm a little on the fence about getting a copy of Granada now  or wait for Sekigahara's print. Any opinions comparing both games?",,11,,19,,public

boardgames,How do you guys play mafia (werewolf)?,False,3,0,"So some people brought the mafia game from Russia to our country and opened a club and a league for that. They claim they are playing the official competitive version with World Competition rules:  


* The game is for exactly 10 + Moderator
* It always has the same roles: 5 townsmen, 1 Sherif, two regular mafias, and a Don(mafia's boss)
* On the first night, the don decides with the mafia on who to kill (static or by the pattern for the advanced player)
* During the day everyone has one minute to talk; they are not allowed to talk outside of their minute
* during the night the mafia marks the Moderator who they kill without opening their eyes. if they don't choose the same person they miss and no one dies.
* Also, during the night the Sherif can search for the mafia and the Don for the Sherif.
* From the second we can start eliminating people, everyone must vote at the end of the round.
* Talking out of your time, touching, cursing, be emotional gives you a strike. on 3 strikes you are losing your minute on four you are out.
* Strike during the night count as four strikes.

The game is over when there are no more mafias, or the mafia is equal to the number of players.  
So I looked for a kit for that and found only mafia games with a lot of roles and very different from what we played...  


So maybe it is a simple version? I know it sounds simple, but we have hand signs to mark things when we are not allowed to talk, and the game can go very deep with the strategies :-)",,15,,3,,public

Board game is free but recipient pays postage (revolut). Estimated postage to Europe zones is 9 to 12 EUR without tracking, and 13 to 20 with tracking. You choose.

Europe only, as postage to other continents is lengthy and costly. You'd probably be cheaper getting them locally if you're outside Europe.

I will wait a good 48 hours to ensure everyone has had a chance to look at it, and then I will choose the recipients, who I will contact by PM.

If more than one person wants the game, I will choose by assigning everyone a number and then using a random number generator

boardgames,"Name some favorite games that ""bombed"" when you played them with a gaming group!",False,42,0,"I have several favorite games that I can only play with certain groups of people or individuals bcause something about the theme or gameplay turns players off completely. 

My first example is 'The Bloody Inn.' I love the story of a sinister family of hotel owners in competition to scheme with or murder their guests for the most profit. The theme was too dark for one of the groups I played with and they resented that once you reached the top of the money track, you had to spend a turn ""laundering,"" money into franc tokens so you could make more. 

Second is 'Galaxy Trucker,' which left several players furious when the randomness of the asteroid collisions decimated a ship they had been painstakingly crafted well past the timer ( I was lax on the timer rules since it was a first play). As a result, they claimed the game was pointless. I love the nail-biting chaos that results from watching your hastily-made ship come apart in the most hilarious ways, but to each their own. 

And finally, 'Shadows of Malice.' I've never been able to get anyone else into this game. They either hate how sparse and symbol-heavy the artwork is, or they don't have any interest in the mechanics and random monster generator. This one I at least understand, since it is a rather crazy set of rules and relies on the players' imagination and ability to embrace the theme.

boardgames,Specific game mechanics that elevate a game from competent to sublime?,False,38,0,"I'll start with a few:

**Arkham Horror LCG** - the chaos bag; essentially a modular 16-sided die, the chaos bag allows for customizable difficulty. There is something so exhilarating about groping in the bag before drawing, knowing that I'm brushing against success and failure, and that I control which destiny I pull. The clackity-clack of coin capsules makes this experience even better! The game itself is great, but the chaos bag makes it one of the best of all time.

**Spirit Island** - the invader track; allows the players to see into the future and anticipate invader actions before they act, allowing you to optimize every move and plan for their demise with meticulous glee. Made even better by the Event deck, which adds just enough unpredictability to throw off your best-laid plans",,64,,38,,public
boardgames,"Games where you build something (landscapes, towns, patterns) - which games are your favorites and why?",False,24,0,"I really love games where I can build or create something. It can be in a more abstract sense, e.g. engine building (Race for the Galaxy, Terraforming Mars), or more literal, where you create a landscape, like Cascadia. I wanna talk about the latter. Disclaimer: this is all very subjective and when I'm critical of ones aspect of a game, it doesn't mean I don't like the game (e.g. Terraforming Mars) or not even that I don't like the look overall (e.g. Everdell might be the best looking game I have).

Over time I noticed a a few preferences of mines: 

1. Obviously a game has to be sound mechanically and be fun, but aesthetics are really important to me. Take **Terraforming Mars** or the map in **Ark Nova**, for example. It gets the job done, but it isn't fun to look at it. TM also lacks variety (ocean, greenery, city). **Cascadia** is nothing groundbreaking in this regard, but it's nice to look at and I enjoy figuring out how to place the next tile. 

2. The (subjectively) right theme makes a big difference, too. **Azul** looks fantastic, but what am I even doing? IIRC it is about producing tiles, however, it doesn't matter for the gameplay, I'm just putting the tiles where they need to go with little rhyme or reason. It's not satisfying. Games like **Cascadia** (nature + animals) and **Kingdomino** let me build a landscape. **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** lets me build a castle and even if I think it could look nicer, 

3. A downside of all this is that disturbing the pattern, even if advantageous gameplay-wise, is unsatisfying. When playing **Kingdomino** I always shied away from taking the swamp(?) tiles, i.e. the light brown ones. I often just call it ""mud"". 

4. Despite #3, I much prefer games where it's possible to ""screw up"" like this over games where I don't care if I interrupt a pattern. Because if I don't care about it, it also means I don't enjoy making these patterns in the first place. Maybe not the perfect example, but **Kanagawa** fits the bill for me. The cards are nice, but I find myself somewhat indifferent to the painting I'm creating. **Everdell** looks amazing, but the town I'm building...well, visually it doesn't feel like I'm building a town, I'm putting cards down next to each other.

If I had to sum my sentiment, I would say it comes down to this: can I be happy with my game even if I lose, maybe even badly? Can I look at my board and be content with what I created?",,39,,24,race-for-the-galaxy,public

Broom Service does feel Halloweeny - even though you are not doing anything scary/ spooky/ evil in the game, just that it's based around witches. Conversely, Quacks of Quedlinburg, despite being wizards putting things into cauldrons - very Halloween - doesn't.   

In the fantasy genre, it's even more subtle. ""Welcome To the Dungeon"" feels Halloween - creeping into a deep dark dungeon with goblins and skeletons in it but Descent obviously isn't, despite going into a deep dark dungeon with goblins and skeletons. 

Some games are 'Halloween feeling' because they 'feel' scary, dark, spooky, tense, and others do just because of the theming.

boardgames,Tips and advice for a after school board games club,False,31,0,"Hello all, as the title suggests I'm hoping to run an after school board games club. The session will be roughly an hour and 15 minutes, once a week. 

Some background: I work at a UK school, and the club will be aimed at key stage two (7-10 years old roughly). 

I just wanted some ideas, advice and any board game recommendations that I haven't thought of myself.

Obviously my first session will be more about getting to know the kids, their experiences and what they've played and anything they'd like to try. I will also be writing a contract with some simple guidelines and expectations as a lot of the games will be from my own collection. 

The games that I own and I am thinking of using are: 
Dobble 
Speedy words 
Cobra paw 
Timeline 
Anomia 
Dominoes 
Top trumps 
Guess who 
Colour brain 
Herd mentality 
Word on the street 
Abalone 
Machi koro 
Love letter 
Marrakech 
Codenames 
5 second rule 

If you can suggest any others that would be great. I am of course going to have the basic and easy to play games like snakes and ladders, etc. As each week I will focus on introducing one new game and teach it to a group and then help them to teach it to the other members.",,16,,31,,public
boardgames,Kemet Blood and Sand components question,False,5,0,"hello,

I recently acquired a new copy of Kemet Blood and Sand. Most everywhere I have seen, the rule book and back of the box lists ""5 Player Aids"" included. edit: the back of my retail box also says ""5 Player Aids"" included

However, my retail copy only came with 3 Player Aids and the included rule book only lists 3 Player Aids in the components.

Has anyone else experienced this? I know on the KS Page, Matagot/Asmodee lists ""5 Player Aids in the core box"" so I am a bit confused.

boardgames,Great Western Trail 2E “Grinder” Action,False,9,0,"Today ended a ridiculously high scoring game: 155 to 128.

Within a short time, between ribbons and my thin deck I was scoring a minimum 19 points every time I made it around the board. 

When we were picking up, I noticed the grinder icon in 2E doesn’t have a -1 cost… it appears it pays you a coin! Is that correct?  (I can’t find my rule book.)

boardgames,Pax Games comparison in 2022,False,15,0,"Hi All,

I have Pamir 2e and have really enjoyed it... Will happily play anywhere from 3-5p, haven't done 2p or with the automa.

Given that this is a reimagined version of the original and is meant to be more accessible, and I've enjoyed it more than enough, I'd like to get ONE of the original 3 pax games (Porf, Pamir 1e, ren 1 or 2e). Did some searching on the sub and there's some info/discussion, but a lot of it is old and doesn't account for either both new 2es, other game releases, etc.

I'm guessing that Pamir 1e wouldn't be worth it since I have 2e, but could someone compare/contrast the games so that I can decide which of Porf and ren (or another) is right for me/anyone else who is interested? Since Pamir is great 3-5 I'm leaning Ren, as people seem to think it's best 2-3 and doable at 4... but a lot of people also seem to think Porf is also fine at 2 and more fun to play! Just not sure which way to go.

Thanks in advance.",,30,,15,,public
boardgames,Gloomhaven too hard? What are we doing wrong?,False,55,0,"Hey, as the game is free to play on Epic right now, my gf and I used this opportunity to try it out before buying it for the collection. We played the tutorials and thought we got most of the mechanics (which evidently was not the case, as we had a few misplays due to poor understanding of rules). First try was at Normal difficulty and we had pretty much no chance. Started with -4hp road encounter and could just open the last door before collapsing. 

Second try I changed it to Easy and houseruled, that \*0 and \*2 were removed from the Modifierdeck (we got fucked over hard with the constant negative modifiers). As we knew what to expect in the first dungeon, we finished it successfully, but only barely. Mainly the last Archer went before me with a low initiative and got a +2 modifier, hitting me for 5 which I could not prevent (2 cards for the turn, no card active, only one card disabled). I would have had two more turns (this and next) and could have looted the treasure but alas my gf had to finish the archer and the last skeleton.

The next dungeon was even more frustrating. Multiple times our strategies were disrupted. We are getting immobilized while the boss ports around the room, fine. Got rid of the archer and wanted to lay on the boss, he then spawns a skeleton with ini 10 or so in the exact spot where I wanted to jump to, sigh. While he attacked twice between the first and second door, he then proceeds to immediately open door 3 and 4 after it. We could not keep up with his movement. Got back to him eventually, he tries to open a fifth door (wtf), we thought he would probably do nothing, but no, he ported again to the opposite site of the room. At this point we were just frustrated and that the modifiers were fucking with us again did not help either.

I mean sure, maybe it was bad luck. But it was on Easy and we spend a good while to determine our turns, this should not be this hard. Also it seems the Modifierdeck is just one more thing which is negative for the players, as the + are useless when you want to kill something (it just leads to overkill damage). We now know what happens again, but it can't be expected from the player to play every scenario twice. Also I am not even sure that we can beat it with our current setup (Brute and Mindthief), as we are neither mobile nor good with AoE. We thought of 1-2 possible strategies afterwards but they also could be easily disrupted again.. Is it easier with four characters instead of two? Please tell us, what we are missing because as of now, it feels not good to waste 2h due to RNG and we are debating to pick it up again.",,107,,55,,public

boardgames,Tiny Epic Dinosaurs - Review &amp; Video,False,7,0,"(Full video review here: https://youtu.be/VGKIzECPKHk)

Tiny Epic Dinosaurs is a worker placement game designed by Scott Almes, and published by Gamelyn games, where 1-4 ranchers compete to create and operate a dinosaur ranch.

In Tiny Epic Dinosaurs, players will be trying to construct a secure ranch, in which to place, feed, and breed a variety of dinosaurs to supply various contracts. They'll be researching new dinosaurs and various technologies to assist with the process, carefully balancing the need to enclose and feed these creatures.

Of course, nothing is ever that simple, and it's all too easy to slip up, letting dinosaurs escape, break the barricades, or even eat each other.

Let's take a look.

I'm a huge fan of the Tiny Epic series of games. The games themselves are all incredibly well designed with gripping rules across a variety of themes and gaming genres. Each of them is a Big Box Game experience, crammed into a tiny box that's stuffed to the lid with high quality components, which makes them perfect for our groups. Remember, I have to ship my games from the UK, so size and weight are huge cost factors for us. That often means we're stuck with smaller, lighter games.

Not so with the Tiny Epic games, and Tiny Epic Dinosaurs is absolutely no exception.

Inside the box are literally hundreds of teeny tiny wooden screen cut dinosaurs and other detailed components, from the ranchers that you use to carry out various tasks, to the meat, veg, and crate markers used to track your resources. Even the turn marker is this tiny little coffee mug that says, adorably, I LOVE DINOS.

The game board, if you can really use that term, is constructed from several sturdy cards that are double sided to vary the game based on player count. There are stacks of small cards used for research and contracts, and finally, there's a small screen printed dice for wrangling.

Gamelyn Games do also sell a neoprene playmat to help organise the cards and make it look prettier. We don't have it, and whilst it looks awesome, it does add an extra component to the game that massively increases the amount of stuff you need to transport and store, but I suppose it does also protect the cards if you're playing on rougher tabletops.

The fact that this all comfortably fits in the box is a constant source of astonishment, but I did grab this excellent plastic insert from a German company called Feldherr, and I honestly can't imagine life without it as it keeps everything neatly separated, reducing set up and clear up times, and smoothing the game experience too.

Set up is pretty easy. You set out the board depending on the number of players, hand each player a ranch card and a player card, along with a set of tracking pieces and a matching set of workers.

With the Deluxe Edition, there's also this laboratory card that adds a small twist to the gameplay. We'll talk more about this later.

Each player is given a secret private contract, and a small starting amount of resources based on who the first player is. Then the game starts.

At the start of each round, each ranch generates resources based on the number of resource icons still visible. Here you can see the ranch naturally generates one supply crate, three meat, and five veg. As the game continues and players fill their ranches with dinosaurs, these icons will be blocked off and so won't generate resources.

Players go around the table assigning ranchers to various tasks. Sometimes you want to build some barriers to construct enclosures. Sometimes you need some extra food to ensure everyone is fed. Sometimes you want to grab some of the research cards. Sometimes you want to fulfil a contract and hand in some dinosaurs to nab some victory points.

Now, of course, you can't hand in a contract if you don't have the dinosaurs yet, so you'll need to wrangle some.

On this card, you can spend resources to grab a specific dinosaur, or you can attempt to wrangle one. Wrangling doesn't use resources but it does sometimes have some unexpected results based on this dice roll.

If it's a net, congratulations, you wrangled a dinosaur. If you roll an egg, congratulations, you actually wrangled two! Sometimes this can be awesome as it helps you get your ranch running quicker, but sometimes it's the absolute worst, especially if you're running low on food or space!!

Finally, if you roll a claw symbol, then the dinosaur and the rancher are moved to medical leave. We assume the poor guy got stepped on or something.

Medical Leave isn't actually as bad as it sounds. You'll get your rancher back at the end of the turn, and you'll still get the dinosaur, and there are even some cards and abilities that trigger when your workers return from medical... but your worker is no longer blocking the wrangling space.

In many worker placement games, when a worker is assigned to a task, that's it. Nobody else can do it. In Tiny Epic Dinosaurs, a blocked space can still be used, assuming the player who wants to use it assigns more ranchers. If there's one guy already on the task, other players who want to use it will have to assign two ranchers, and so on.

It's worth noting that your Lead Rancher, this big guy, counts as two ranchers for the purposes of assigning and blocking. He can be very useful in a pinch!

Once all players have assigned their ranchers to tasks and collected the various cards, resources and Dinos they've earned, everyone collects up their ranchers and proceeds to arrange their ranch.

When you look at a ranch card, you'll see it has water and mountains. These already provide natural barriers to enclose dinosaurs, but you'll undoubtedly need some barricades to finish the enclosures. Enclosures can only contain dinosaurs of the same type, so you can't put a velociraptor in the same enclosure as a stegosaurus *** and you can't even put a stegosaurus and a brachiosaurus together.

If you cannot place a dinosaur into an enclosure, it escapes, and we'll talk more about escapes later on.

Once all of your barriers and dinosaurs have been happily placed, players must feed all of their dinosaurs. Stegosaurus and Brachiosaurus eat one or two veg each, respectively; and Velociraptors and Allosaurus eat one or two meat each respectively.

You must attempt to feed all of your dinosaurs and if you cannot feed a dinosaur, it escapes.

Finally, any fed dinosaur in an enclosure with another of the same type will breed. So these two, having been fed, will breed a third dinosaur. This doesn't have to be fed, but if you can't place it, it also escapes.

At this point it should be fairly apparent that it's pretty easy for dinosaurs to escape if you've not planned carefully!

Or if you're me, even careful planning isn't enough. I have a love-hate relationship with this die, and I inevitably screw something up...

If a dinosaur escapes, one of two things happen. If it was a carnivore, it eats one of your other dinosaurs on the way out. This sounds bad, but it can actually be useful if you need to thin the populations in your ranch. You can even use it to stop another Dino escaping.

If a herbivore escapes, it smashes down a barricade on the way out. Again, this sounds bad, but it won't necessarily screw you over. If you ended the Arrange Ranch phase with most of your Dino's enclosed, they won't escape if the barriers later break, but it may stop them breeding.

I guess they don't like being watched??

Each dinosaur escape penalty can only be applied once. So if you have an entire heard of stegosaurus escape, you'll still only lose a single barrier. Then, if you can't feed a Brachiosaurus later and it escapes, it won't take another barrier with it. So it's not too bad.

And that's basically it. You refresh the board and do this a total of five more times, then the game ends.

Now during later turns, there are some other things that may happen. Once you have a few dinosaurs in your ranch, you may be starting to eye up some of those contracts. If you have the right dinosaurs in your ranch, you can hand them in to complete a contract, and at this time, you may also complete that Private Contract you were given earlier. But only if you're also completing a Public Contract.

This is where the real difficulty comes into the game. On one hand, you want to hand your Dino's off quickly to secure the contract you want before someone else claims it. You'll also want to hand in those food guzzling Dino's quickly before your ranch is simply overrun. Also, contracts are worth more than the Dino's spent on them, and will free up space for you to continue breeding.

Hand in too quick, however, and your ranch will be left empty, with no dinosaurs left to build towards other contracts forcing you to start from scratch.

The real genius moment is when you realise you can hand in a load of contracts, and still have enough dinosaurs to breed and keep your ranch running, but it's a real knife-edge sometimes, and there's nothing worse than hanging back just long enough for the player before you to steal the contract you need, the only one you could fulfil, leaving you with a burgeoning ranch of hungry Dino's and not enough feed to keep it going.

This happens astonishingly frequently. At least, if you're me.

We touched on the research cards briefly earlier, but these are some of my favourite things in Tiny Epic Dinosaurs. Sometimes these are useful tools like a security force that captures escaping dinosaurs, or stronger barriers that don't break. Sometimes they're endgame tools that give bonus points if certain conditions are met.

But sometimes, they're special unique dinosaurs with really cool abilities.

The Triceratops, for example, may take a LOT of veg to feed, but it scores additional points based on other dinosaurs around it.

The Pterodactyl is cheap to feed and can be paid in meat to transfer dinosaurs from your holding area to the ranch so that you can hand them in for contracts the same turn you wrangled them.

Everyone's favourite, the T-Rex is a beast to feed, but worth a good deal of points and... Perhaps worryingly... You can feed spare Dino's to it instead, and actually earn some meat in the process. Grim, but efficient.

These special dinosaurs don't even need to be properly enclosed, which is awesome, and there's tonnes of variety to keep you going!

At the start of your fourth turn, you also gain an extra rancher and another private contract, which helps up the tension in those later rounds too!

Eventually, the sixth turn ends, and players tally up their points based on their contracts, their research cards, and any dinosaurs left in the ranch. The player with the most points wins!

Tiny Epic Dinosaurs is actually a really straightforward game to play, but there's a lot of possibilities. From turn to turn you'll be trying to balance your need for more dinosaurs, alongside the barriers to enclose them and food to feed them.

It constantly feels like you're always on the verge of running out of something, and play moves swiftly from player to player so you never end up with that situation where you take your turn then end up waiting ages before you can do anything else.

The Tiny Epic games are great for this. Every one of them has all players focused on the board at all times, engaged and present. There's also very little competitive gameplay, you're never attacking another player or purposefully messing with each other, which is a real plus for a group like ours. We don't like that aggression. We don't mind competing, but being able to gang up on another player is a mechanic we don't like. And it doesn't happen here at all.

Now, in the Deluxe Edition, you also get the laboratory expansion, also available direct on the Gamelyn Games website. With this mini expansion, each of the task boards has a number of science tokens on it. If you place a worker on that card, you must take a token, then advance your microscope along the corresponding line. This will occasionally earn you rewards, and like the wrangling die, this can sometimes be an awesome addition that you're aiming for, or sometimes a bonus free dinosaur that you just didn't really want and now you have to enclose it, feed it and URGH.

If you only have the base version though, don't worry too much. Whilst our group tends to use the laboratory mini expansion now, we played it for a long time without it and loved the game. It adds another micro layer to the game that players have to consider, but it's fairly unobtrusive. Playing with it is awesome, but the game doesn't lose much at all without it, and I'm sure there are folks out there who prefer just the base game.

At this point, I ask the question, ""Does Tiny Epic Dinosaurs join our crew, or do we make it walk the plank?"" and this is an easy recommendation.

For us, the tiny box and cheap price made it easy to ship, and it's a great game to shove in a bag when we head up to Msuna or somewhere. But that tiny box contains a huge game packed with top quality components. The game is easy to play, easy to teach, has very little downtime between turns, and great fun for everyone involved.

Sure, it doesn't have the whole Jurrassic Park flavour of the dinosaurs escape and eat everyone, it's much more of a pastoral affair where the focus is on setting up a well-running ranch, but I actually prefer it for this. It's a fairly chill farming game, but with dinosaurs, and what's not to love about that??

If you're after a non-aggressive tabletop experience, or just something to appease the dinosaur loving child inside all of us, then Tiny Epic Dinosaurs is well worth your time.",,2,,7,,public

boardgames,Classic kids games with twists to make them fun for drunk adults,False,5,0,"Hi everyone,

I'm planning a party for my 30th in a couple of months and have taken inspiration from No Rolls Barred's EXCELLENT House Rules series where they play classic kids/family games with a twist to make them more ridiculous or entertaining for adults. I'd like to have a whole suite of these available for people to play at the party and wondered if anyone has any ideas I could use to flesh out the selection?

So far, mostly ripped shamelessly from House Rules, I've got:

Handcuff Twister:
Twister played in teams of two (plus a third to spin the dial). Players are handcuffed together. If one player's handcuffed hand comes up on the dial, the other player's handcuffed hand is freed from its previous position. 

Guess Who with Vibes Only:
Guess who, but you can't ask anything to do with their physical appearance. E. G. 'is their dad proud of them?' 'have they had a threesome?' 

Operation Blindfold:
Operation in teams of two. One player is blindfolded and their teammate has to guide them to the right spot with their voice. Constant sudden death rules. 

Giant Jenga with boxing/other incapacitating gloves

Any ideas for other games? I've steered away from House Rules' video of Battleships where you take a shot every turn as I'd rather have games with rules twists which are more fun after a few drinks rather than being drinking games in and of themselves. 

Other game inspirations I have are below, but haven't got a suitable rules twist for any of them yet:

Screwball Scramble,

boardgames,Dixit Rules Question,False,10,0,"I've owned Dixit for years now and have never faced this situation until a few weeks ago.

My wife and two friends and I were playing a 4 player game of the ""race to 30 points"" Dixit edition. My wife had 29 points. I had 28 points. The other two players were no where near 30 points.

On the last turn of the game, my wife was the active player. She gave a clue that referenced a topic I was familiar with, and I was pretty sure the other two players were not.

Given that I was likely the only person who could both provide a decent red herring and deduce which card was hers, I gambled and made the decision to intentionally vote for a card that *wasn't* hers. 

It paid off. The other two players missed her clue and picked each other's cards, and I also picked one of theirs. Since no one picked the correct card, everyone but my wife received 2 points and I won the game.

Besides my questionable decision to anger my wife, I'm not sure if I did anything wrong. The rules *do* state that ""the goal of the players is to find the active player's card"" and to ""vote in secret for the card he/she thinks is the active player's."" 

But in the above situation, this conflicts with the overall goal of the game — to reach 30 points. It's also an unenforceable rule (maybe I *did* think that was her card after all). Should I knowingly lose the overall game by choosing correctly, or is it okay to be incorrect to win the overall game?

I'm sure many will say that this is way too complicated and gamey for a game like Dixit. And you're absolutely right. But my wife and I are competitive people, so I'd still love to know what other people think!",,17,,10,,public

boardgames,"Thinking about investing in Twilight Imperium, but am a bit intimidated. Need advice.",False,13,0,"I've been heavily involved in the boardgame hobby for about 10 years now, and own around 70 games (of which I play about 20 on a fairly regular basis).  Currently my wife and I are about 20% done with Crimson Scales, and loving it immensely.

I've always avoided Twilight Imperium because of the sheer weight of the game (both physically and mentally) and the cost (both financially and time-wise).  But recently I've been drawn to it for various reasons, and after watching about 6 videos on 'how to' as well as playthrough, I am really considering it.  However, I have some questions and concerns:

1. how steep is the learning curve?  Do you have it mostly figured out after playing an hour or two, or do you need to play it through a few times before you really know what you're doing?
2. if I've played the game myself a few times, and want to introduce it to a friend, is there any chance a newbie can win when playing their first game, or would it be no contest (this is obviously related to question 1 above)
3. will serious, strategic gamers always prevail over casual players?  In other words, can someone just play for fun and still compete based on (perhaps) some luck, or does a few mistakes sort of steamroll into a losing campaign?  Can you catch up if way behind?
4. can you pretty much tell who is NOT going to win after 3 hours?  If you play a 4-player game, and you come in last place, did you know you were certain to lose for several hours, or did you have realistic hope all the way until the end (maybe the last 30 minutes) that you had a chance?
5. If 4 people are all newbies, playing for the 1st time, would it make sense to play the game for an hour or two, and then start over (everything new) for a better understood experience?  If I get the game and share it with friends, we'll all be noobs, and I think knowing what you're doing is more fun than guessing.

Any other advice would be appreciated.  Thanks!

How might I do something similar with every board I have. How could this work in a way that's a little more interesting and has a true sense of progression across each game than just keeping a running total of points?

 For example could a couple cards of your choice stay in your deck after each round reset? Could you keep some gold between games? Might these benefits have a cost (clank, gold etc) up front to do? I'm curious if other people have tried this kind of thing or if not, do you think it might be a fun and viable gaming experience?

My wife flooded the bathroom last night and it started leaking through the floor directly onto our boardgame shelf in the basement. Luckily she heard it and only 3 or 4 copies of Patchwork on the top shelf got major damage. (Ok that part was a joke).

But seriously, I just happened to have a crappy Walmart Guess Who knockoff along with a couple of games still in shrinkwrap on the top shelf and they maganed to shield most of the games below from the worst of it. We were able to get everything moved away and toweled off quickly so only 3 or 4 boxes got some water stains. I don't think anything inside was damaged from the look of it.

Aaaaanyway, that corner of the house is really the only space we can reasonably fit these games, but we are worried about flooding again. It's an old enough house that I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again (we have some people inspecting for water damage anyway). This probably is more of a DIY/handyman question, but thought you guys might have some ideas since board game storage/protection/organization seems to be a topic that people here have a lot of knowledge on in this sub.

boardgames,Suburbia Questions,False,7,0,"Busted out suburbia collectors edition and taught a group of friends who've never played it before. I'm not quite sure how to word what happened but here we go. Also, to preface, because it was a learning game we didn't use the secret objectives, and I think the last place player was something like 45 rep, and first place was like 67

One friend thought that water purification plant was incredibly broken and swingy. He said it gives the first person to buy it such an incredibly leap that nobody else can possibly catch up. Also fwiw, that tile showed up 3 times in the 4p game. He felt like this game, or at least this experience, makes it to be one of those games where if you have a bad early game, you spend the rest of the game watching everyone else win (my experience with catan and new players).

Another friend interpreted the rules for the tiles as saying that you have to pay $2 for every industrial tile you have every single turn, which is the trade off for how cheap it is vs how much of a reputation buff it gives you. I told him that given that the mix of tiles we got wasn't very industrial heavy, it was a fairly powerful card for this game, but if someone was banking on making an industrial focused set up, it would punish them pretty hard. He didn't really think that to be the case and strongly believe it punishes you every turn, and that every turn you...reset everything and recalculate everything, which sounds off because the board keeps up with this for you, but I couldn't find a rule that expressly says things only happen once.

Being that we were using the collectors edition, I get the impression that mixing all the tiles up kind of detracts from the experience. Like we had some of the halloween/moon symbol tiles that played off other tiles with the same symbol, but for awhile we never saw any other tiles with that symbol. They didn start showing up in the C stack, but yeah. First time I played the game was with the basic core set, this is first time I used any expansions.

boardgames,Six New Games!!,False,27,0,"Yesterday, our box arrived here in Zimbabwe, from the UK, with six new games in it (https://youtube.com/shorts/qXtRORX-LIg?feature=share)

We picked up:

• Skulls of Sedlec

• Sprawlopolis

• Skull King

• Kariba

• Regicide (played with standard decks before but I love the art)

• Tiny Epic Kingdoms


So far:

Skulls of Sedlec is awesome. My wife is a big ""skull"" fan. Slap a skull on it and she wants it. We played five rounds yesterday at 2 and 3 player, and I'm in love. It's one of those games where the limitations (one action, two card hand size) are frustrating in a good way. Easy to play, rules are easy to memorize due to the theme, and I love the art.

I've played three solo games of Sprawlopolis, won one, lost two. Delightfully thinky, works well as solo and I'm keen to try multiplayer. Astonished at how small this game is but how big it feels. Worried it might ""grow old"" when I've seen all the objectives, but I guess there are then a tonne of expansions 😅

Skull King. Not played yet, but it sounds amazing and everyone I know who's played it races about it. As my wife is to skulls, I am to pirates. Put a pirate on the box and I'm in. Rulebook suggests leaving mermaids in, but reviews all talk of the ""base game"" being without them? Also seems like there's a TONNE of scope for different modes, etc. Keen to try this at the weekend with the crew.

The second I saw Kariba, I knew I had to get it. Lake Kariba is in Zimbabwe, and I love several of Reiner Knizia's other games (including Loot, of course). Seems weird to name a waterhole game about a lake, but I guess ""Hwange"" (whilst Zimbabwean and technically more fitting) doesn't have the same ring to it. Box is smaller than I anticipated (which is cool) and the game sounds easy fun. Looking forward to teaching our live-in niece and nephew!

Not much to say about Regicide. I love the game in general, have only played solo before. The art on the ""official"" deck is just gorgeous and I think will help remind players of what the different suits do. Of course, we COULD use it for standard card games, but I think a round of Egyptian Rat Screw might just wreck the deck, so I'll stick to a standard Bicycle deck for that, haha! 

Tiny Epic Kingdoms surprised me actually. We've played a LOT of Galaxies, Dinosaurs, Zombies, Pirates, and Dungeons, and I was surprised at how slim Kingdoms is (no stacks of cards?) I've only played a single 1v1 against my wife, so far, but I really enjoyed the pace, the versatility of the races, and how quick the game plays. We didn't use the Exploration mini-expansion in our first game, which I think we will use in our first group game this weekend. My only quibble is that war seems really... Obvious? I like that there's no RNG, but I can easily read my opponents race cards and see if war is worth it. I guess the point is to sometimes throw a meeple at them just to get them to burn resources as you immediately surrender? Intrigued to play more of this.

Or perhaps a list of submit at your own risk.

I'm aware everyone copies from everyone else in every industry, and that's how products improve but perhaps there are some companies to leave for last?

Hasbro is a big company, so they are bound to get accusations just because of their large size. But some of these accusations I didn't like and felt better to stay away for now. I'm not sure if I'm over analyzing.

boardgames,War of the ring rules explanation,False,7,0,"Hey I was playing and had several questions to clarify.  
When playing free people, when you take damage from a battle, can you demote an elite if you have no regulars left or can you take a regular from the “dead” pile or does it take it from the fresh recruits. 

Also with Nazgûl’s can you recruit them with a muster die and if so, and Nazgûl’s get killed, can you revive them and spawn them again. 

My other question would be when attacking a stronghold that hasn’t had people hiding yet for instance my friend had 8 regular/elite units on minas tirith, does this attack only allow hits on 6 still or do the free people get punished for having a fight outside their stronghold and get hit by 5’s. 

Also if a fight happens outside the stronghold, can the party inside the stronghold fight the army on top of them or are they not allowed to move at all until a shadow army is not on top of them. 

For the hunt, let’s say I have 3 eyes in the eyes hunt before the fellowship move. The player moves the fellowship now for the first time. Do I immediately roll for those 3 die and only hit on 6’s and roll again if he has moved again on this turn rotation and now I hit on 5’s and if he moves again I roll and draw on if I hit at least one four.

The intrigue and political play of Game of Thrones always astonished me. However, I never found a game that had that level of player interaction and the possibility of building alliances and complex social networks. After reading hundreds of game rules, I discovered there was no game out there like that. I started searching for mechanics that could allow for such a game, but I found none! Cosmic Encounter is perhaps the best alliance-building, simple but complex board game (which has one of the most play counts in my group) but it is still far from the experience I was looking for. So, I started to explore designing a game with these elements and, after many trials and errors, ended up with Elven Throne. Gameplay summarized below:

* Simple Rules - Focus on your own strategy instead of being overwhelmed by complicated rules
* Alliances – Supports cooperation and competition with a twist on win conditions
* Extremely Interactive – Interactive mechanics allow players to always be active, even on other players' turns
* A Chess-like Sensation of a Surprise Master Plan  (i.e., no hidden information)
   *  Many games allow surprising moves by hiding information. This is easy to do, but hidden information also cripples the possibility of players reacting to and reading into each others' plans (which is a big part of the game, say, reading each other’s minds!). Elven Throne allows this to happen without hiding information itself, in the same way that it is hard to predict a chess player's move even though nothing is hidden from either player

boardgames,Any good house rules for getting a complete Gloomhaven experience?,False,0,0,"So I played Gloomhaven on TTS during the pandemic with friends. My group and I met every Sunday evening to play through a scenario; after a about 4 or 5 it became clear that it would take multiple playthroughs for us to experience everything the game has to offer, all of the characters, items, side quests etc.

Whilst we really enjoyed the experience, realistically none of us were ever going to play it through from beginning to end again, at least for the foreseeable future, which made me regret not being able to try all the classes and unlocks. One of the house rules we implemented to at least try and boost our party was that we would be allowed to claim all coins and treasure chests on a map if at the end of the scenario no monsters were still in play; even still, we did not get to experience everything the game had to offer. 

With Frosthaven now due in a couple of months I’m wondering what house rules or changes people would recommend to get the most out of it (assuming somewhat similar progression and unlock mechanics)? This is assuming that you get just a single playthrough with a dedicated 4 person group that can only get together, at best, once a month now.",,20,,0,glory-to-rome,public

boardgames,Finally got a dedicated board game shelf!,False,90,0,"And I'm darn sure proud of it! I've been involved with the hobby since early 2019, starting slowly, and building up to now. First game was Twilight Imperium 4ed, and that didnt got so well, lol. After that, I got Scythe, which we used to play 2-3 times an evening. It is probably still my single most played game, not counting Gloomhaven.  I just love discovering new, unique worlds board games can bring into my home - and I'd dare say I'd give any oddity and a weird game a fair chance and try.

Wouldnt change much really - I heard all the horror stories of game collections reaching eldritch proportions that refuse to be tamed, but then again, I'd sure love more games, but I'd also love to somehow get the time needed to play them. And i hate reaching for the rulebook, and teaching has been getting tiresome lately. I still kinda miss the feeling we had while Scythe was more or less the only game - everyone knew the rules perfectly, no consulting the rulebook, games are fast, and so on. Lately tho, I fell out of love with Scythe - while I still love its more or less unique ""cold war"" gameplay, where the threat of combat is probably all you are gonna see until the very late game, and its presentation and table presence are amazing - I sorta grew disillusioned with it over its game balance. Invaders from Afar, while being quite fun to play, feel a hell lot weaker than base game factions, and certain combinations are just plain bad. Sadly, Scythe isnt much like say Root, where the shaky balance can be self-regulated by the gameplay itself, due to its focus on the threat of combat instead of combat itself. I'm also sorta collectionist - I insist on having every single expansion, promo or module, which can cause a slight headache from time to time.

Still have lots of empty space tho, and i just love discovering new, unique games. Any suggestions with what to fill it? I've been thinking of getting some lighter games, namely Cosmic Frog which I just cant find anywhere, and perhaps Brian Boru, which seems to be quite fast, light and yet deep and replayable.

boardgames,So I played Dominion for the first time last weekend at my brothers house and I’m in love,False,21,0,"I’m actually a fairly avid board game player (though maybe not compared to a lot of you), so I’m not sure how I’ve managed to miss this game for basically 15 years.  Anyway, my reason for posting is that I want to buy Dominion, but seeing how many versions and expansions there are, I want to make an informed purchase. So now I will provide some context to help you all give me the best possible advice.

I have 3 kids that I play board games with semi-frequently (though not as much as we’d all like), ages 12, 10, and 6.  The 2 older ones are definitely ahead for their ages, and greatly enjoy playing Catan, 7 Wonders, Civ IV A New Dawn (these first 3 are my favorites), Pandemic, Munchkin, many of the Forbidden Island games, Risk, and Stratego.  My 6 year olds favorite games probably shouldn’t factor in, as that will likely change a lot over the next few years.  My wife’s favorite games are social games like Beyond Balderdash, but she also quite likes 7 Wonders and Acquire (high on my list as well).  As a family, we enjoy 5 minute dungeon because the team aspect and it includes the 6 year old.

I also play with a range of adults maybe every other month or so, who would likely enjoy Dominion quite a bit. 

As for cost, perhaps I could justify up to $100, but surely we can spend less than that and get plenty of hours of enjoyment.",,30,,21,,public

boardgames,Opinions on AuZtralia,False,23,0,"I’d been interested in [AuZtralia by Martin Wallace](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/231581/auztralia) since it appeared on the shelves a little while ago, and recently picked up a copy when I saw it on sale.

For those who don’t know, British designer Wallace is very prolific and his many games include Brass, DiscWorld, Steam, London, Via Nebula and A Study in Emerald, and I like some of them but dislike others.

For examples, the rarely-seen or mentioned [Via Nebula](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191231/nebula) has a fascinating blend of map exploration and shared incentives, whereas the otherwise very popular [Brass](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28720/brass-lancashire) seems vastly over-complicated to me. 

A few games in to AuZtralia I’m impressed that the unlikely blend of Lovecraftian horror and early 20th Century Australia doesn’t at all seem forced\*), and his use of Time as an action cost is engaging, adds tension, and is highly thematic. (Time is running out before the Old Ones awaken and rampage across the lands).

For example, towards the end of the game you can spend more Time to build a stronger military force, but might run out of Time (and time) to actually get them in to combat.

Then whilst the rules aren’t difficult to learn, they are complicated (having many parts); the combat and moves for the Old Ones (essentially an automata) are absurdly fiddly, and all the games seem to take twice as long as they ought to.

I haven’t tried a 2-player or solitaire game yet, and suspect the 2-player will need players to start close to one another, and that the game might actually be *better* as a solitaire than with 4 players! 

So it’s a curious game, and I wondered if others with experience of it have any remarks about the way the game develops for players after multiple games, or comments about Wallace’s designs with respect to his other games perhaps?

I know everyone attending, but I also know that a couple of the new players get intimidated by anything beyond Exploding Kittens, Trial by Trolley, Cards Against Humanity, etc. They're open to the experience, but I want to ensure I can make it as seamless as possible and not overwhelming.  

I'm not springing Gloomhaven, Spirit Island, or anything remotely like that on them. We'll be playing Forgotten Waters, which I'm hoping will be interesting enough to keep them engaged but without being overbearing mechanically (also, my collection generally leans toward the heavier side, so this is probably the best I've got). I also figured a co-op would be best, but even then, I know at least one of the group will have an ""I'm going to be the weak link and drag everyone down"" mindset, which is simply not true.

boardgames,Games with “texty” Cards/Tokens,False,8,0,"Over the years, I’ve realized that I tend not to prefer games with dozens of unique “texty” cards ie: cards with loads of text describing Actions or Events or some other game outcome. 


eg: a card called “**Iron Shepard**” that lets you Take 2 coins for every sheep on your board. Exception: if any other player has a *black* sheep, then this card has no effect. Compensate that player with 2 sausages unless they *also* hold the **Jade Grill** card in which case, give them 3 sausages and set **Threat Level** to ***obsidian***. 


It feels like these cards/games have drawn a lot of inspiration from Magic The Gathering (something which I personally never got into) and maybe that’s the appeal? I acknowledge that having such cards makes a game vastly replayable (“ah, I didn’t see this Hatchet card on my last play, but here it is now. Time to kill some sheep!!”) but I find that they make games so random and inelegant that I just can’t get into it. 

To cite specific examples: I enjoy Marvel United where the cards are just combinations of 3 symbols (with only a few “texty” cards) but I don’t enjoy Marvel Champions with its 100 unique texty cards.

3. Why do people whip out their phones in between every single turn? Even for just a few seconds of scrolling. Then they inevitably are reminded that it's their turn and have to then think about what to do and hold up the flow of the game, leading to more phones coming out.

boardgames,risk with two players on per team?,False,12,0,"im currently trying to organize a game night with about 10-12 people and i dont have alot of games for so many players so my question is if there is a variant of risk where there are two people on one team that you can play with a base set.

also if you have any special rules to make the game more interesting i would really like know them",,15,,12,,public
boardgames,Has Agricola been surpassed yet for WP?,False,45,0,"I count myself amongst the many who would credit Agricola as THE origin of their love fest with this hobby. It was my introduction to worker placement. I started with the family side of the board, and eventually worked my way up to the occupations and improvements. I love everything this game has to offer, especially the feeding and need to diversify.

As a life-long learner, and find it hard to believe I have yet to encounter a game that does WP better than a game from 2008. Not for lack of trying though. I gave Viticulture a go, but found the visitor cards not only swingy, but the best strategy for winning. Barrage has come very close, but the WP aspect isn't as central to the game as Agricola's. Uwe's other designs such as Feast for Odin, Caverna, and Fields of Arle don't have the same bite and tension that Agricola has.

So I ask, is this as good as it gets, or does there exist a crunchy, tension-filled WP game out there that would satisfy the masochists of the hobby?",,125,,45,,public

It's a fun, standard deck builder! But it ends immediately when someone purchases the last super villain, so does that give the first player an advantage because they had an extra turn to purchase cards?

boardgames,Has the production quality of board games gotten worse recently or am I just unlucky?,False,6,0,"Venting/asking.

The last three games I have bought have all been either missing something or have had damaged components. It seems that I should be able to sort everything with my local board game shop but it's still a bit of a bummer as I most likely have to wait weeks or months for the replacements to arrive. Also the amount of missing cards or damaged components has been minimal but I mean, if I buy a brand new game for full price I do want a brand new game.

boardgames,Glen More II or Ginkgopolis,False,7,0,"Hi, i want to buy new tile laying game and i narrowed my options to Glen More II and Ginkgopolis. What game would you recommend? We would like to know:
What game plays better at 2 players?
What game has a better replayability? (Let's compare base Glen More II without including chronicles as they obviously increase replayability but i would like to know how is it with just a base game)
What game has heavier decisions? We know that mechanically both games are rather easy and similar in weight but we actually like games that are easy to play and hard to master (as in there are multiple ways to win and every choice matters)
What are the average game times? We are looking for a game that we could end in about 1hr, something to close our game night
What game is more competitive? We find competitive games much more fun which lead us to final question 
We realized that most games with tile laying mechanic often make us feel accomplished, like in the end we achieved something, each of us (for example) built a city and it gives us both a lot of satisfaction (no matter who wins, in the end game was fun). What game does that better?",,14,,7,,public
boardgames,What’s your favourite game that is not ranked highly on BGG?,False,159,0,"I used to be convinced that all the best games are already in the top 100, or maybe 300. But after playing some ‘top’ games (many of which are fantastic), but also many of which I simply did not enjoy at all such as pandemic (maybe we played it wrong but it felt one person could just play the game themselves). 

On the other hand I enjoyed games that aren’t ranked super highly score wise like Tokaido (this might be my favourite game). Another example is even though I don’t like monopoly I still enjoyed it more than alternatives like machi koro which gets compared often to monopoly. Maybe I need more play sessions of machi koro since I bought it but I’m keen on giving it another chance. 

I think it depends obviously a lot on personal preferences but are there any hidden gems among the lower ranked games that you guys are a big fan of?

boardgames,Pan am or 7 Wonders Duel?,False,3,0,"I’ve narrowed my picks to play with my senior parent who’s had experiences enjoying catan and parks. she’s played stone age too.

My main question is what might be differences in the enjoyment of playing Pan am or 7 Wonders Duel? What about replayability?

From what I know both are economic strategy games. I love the concept of Pan am for its theme and I’ve read reviews lauding it for how balanced the game is (parks felt balanced too, we played it numerous times. and we loved the theme!)

Now for 7 Wonders I’m wondering if the number of cards that change per round mean more diversity in plays. Is it much more exhilarating to play than pan am? I’ve also heard there are some plays with 7 wonders duel that the player ends up taking turns just to prevent the other from winning, I’m not too sure my parent would enjoy minding another player’s cards often apart from their own.

But, I know 7 wonders duel is a lot like a staple for two-players.

All that to say, if you’ve played both games, I’m interested to see how you’d compare them!

Thanks so much.",,7,,3,,public
boardgames,I hate it when games hide the fact you need an expansion for higher player counts,False,5,0,"I've been looking for a fun 2v2 team based game lately, and it's been really hard to find anything at all. Finally my eye fell on Super Fantasy Brawl. It looked really fun and it was relatively inexpensive. So I was about to buy it when I noticed that it came with 6 heroes. I started looking around how the 2v2 variant is played, but it's like no one has ever bothered to share anything about playing SFB as a team game. I've been able to find a single team play video on Youtube and noticed they were playing 2 heroes per player, so that would mean that 4 player games are not supported out of the box.

There is not a single line anywhere, on any website, that indicates that this is the case. All you ever read is ""2-4 players"". This is just blatantly false advertising and I feel it happens way too often in boardgaming. I've already been burned once by Arkham LGC, where I bought a single starter set and realised that for two players to actually have fun you need to waste money on a second starter set. It feels like so many developers are out to trick you, selling starter and core sets that are barely functional and force you to search through message boards to see what else you need for a proper experience. It makes me weary to spend any money on boardgaming at all.

Anyone else bothered by this or am I blowing it out of proportion?",,15,,5,,public
boardgames,Can’t remember the name of board game,False,12,0,"Hi, I can’t remember a board game I played a few years ago. I will describe it below. Let me know if it rings any bells. Thank you!

There are 2 teams of 2. 

There are maybe 10-12 tiles layed out on the table. Each tile has a word on it.

One (or 2?) tiles are “insta kills”, where if my teammate says it, we automatically lose.

After the tiles are layed out, I tell my teammate a 1 word hint. My teammate now has to look at the tiles and guess as many tiles as possible that relate to my 1 word hint.

For example: let’s say these are all the words on the tiles:
-chicken
-pig
-lettuce
-cow
-milk
-cheese
-water
-cereal
-orange juice
-toothbrush

If chicken is the instakill word, I could tell my teammate “breakfast” as the 1 word hint. My teammate would then hopefully knock out pig, milk, cheese, cereal, orange juice, and toothbrush — gaining 6/10 points total. But let’s say my teammate guessed “chicken” as we’ll, we lost",,12,,12,,public

boardgames,My Dominion storage solution is broken again. I have 2 more full expansions and 3 Upgrade packs to add. What do you guys do to store them all?,False,890,0,,,138,,890,,public
boardgames,Wormholes - interstellar taxi driving,False,20,0,"I haven't really played any 'pick up and deliver' games before playing Wormholes (and I don't doubt that I'll find people who will tell that's still true after having played Wormholes). It's not been a deliberate choice - it's not like I had made a solemn vow never to engage with anything approaching logistical optimisation, but it just happened to pan out there's only two that have really piqued my interest. And, seeing the effusive praise lathered onto Wormholes by Quinten Smith of SUSD fame, I felt like I had to check this one out. 

Before I get into the gameplay, let me talk about what this game is built from. Player pieces look sleek and feel great to touch, the rulebook is nice, clear and *svelte*, and comes with more than enough pieces to do whatever your heart desires during the game. And really, this game is mercifully light on rules; it's almost Knizia-esque in that sense. It's a simple five minute teach and players are ready to fly interstellar tourists off to extraplanetary holiday destinations.

Wormholes, then, is a game where you basically play as rival interplanetary taxi drivers. Each player wants to deliver as many passengers to as many different planets as possible. However, it turns out that space is *huge* and your spaceship is *slow*. ""There has got to be a way around this!"" you scream after spending an entire turn puttering about in your tiny shuttle taxi, inching ever so slowly to your actual destination. And that's where the eponimous wormholes come in. Players will, over the course of the game, create infrastructure in the form of wormholes to massively expedite traveling between points and planets in order to more easily deliver future passengers to planets that have been previously visited. And the tunnels are public, too! Anyone can use your tunnels for the low, low price of just a single point! And honestly, how much is a point really in the grand scheme of things. 

Good wormhole usage (and therefore good wormhole building) really is the difference between a winning game and one where you're feeling kind of lost. It's the difference between same day delivery and feeling like you're stuck in the Suez channel. You want to have access to good tunnels (and a good network of them) to make sure you can actually deliver to those planets you need to hit, and to make sure that it doesn't take you forever to do so. This game really has excellent tempo built in, which is helped along by the player driven game length. 

Each time a player creates the first wormhole next to a planet, they get a reward token and shorten the length of the game just that liiiiittle bit. Once all planets have a wormhole next to them, it's three more turns and then it's done. I really like player-driven tempo as it helps prevent players just sitting around and revving up engines forever until they're just vomiting out buckets of points each turn. This also gives the game a very satisfying have arc, where you start out slow but collectively build up this infrastructure that allows you to zoom across the universe to two or sometimes even three planets by the end of the game. The systems want you to go places, and go there fast! The game is actually very good at incentivising people to go out and explore the galaxy on the table by giving people points for getting to planets first and for going to as many different planets as possible. But really, how much could a few points be? 

So we're approaching the part of the review where the negatives are now. 

With all the things the game does well, there's a few things that I can see as turn-offs for other people. For starters, yes, there is quite some randomness to the game. Wormholes uses its deck to give out objectives for you to chase for points, and you will probably encounter runs off cards that are just better. Having been forged in the fires of competitive Magic the Gathering, I don't really mind; sometimes you draw it and sometimes you don't. That said, I do feel worried about the starting card in particular. Your first delivery/deliveries will probably dictate a lot, and drawing a card that's just flatly on the other side of the universe is disheartening, even if Wormholes does have a very friendly system that allows you to basically dump your hand and draw a new one each turn. It still sucks to realize your neighbours were flying one planet over while you were being sent somewhere a million miles away. 

Then there's also the fact that poor planning or missing a good wormhole can just absolutely destroy you. I've seen it happen multiple times that someone either forgot to drop an entrance somewhere or placed something poorly, only to be forced to spend four turns puttering along while the other players were zipping across the universe raking in points. None of my games have been a blow-out because of it, but it does feel disheartening when you see your opponents breaking the laws of physics while you're on a slow boat stuck in traffic. 

On the topic of scores - I'm unsure how I feel about it. All games I've played had scores closely grouped together, which poses two issues; it disincentives players from using each other's tunnels, and it leads to games where it is impossible to properly evaluate what good play really looks like. The first of these two issues, to me, is the biggest problem that I don't really know how to fix - I'm not sure I even want to. I am however just a little sad that the end game scoring discourages people from interacting with what is arguably the coolest system in the game - the shared tunnel network! The second problem is maybe more of a me problem, but I like to see what actually impressive play looks like. If I play randomly and the other person plays an absolute blinder and we end up, like, three points apart, how do I know what lead to him having a higher score? How will I know what matters?

My last issue is related to player count. The solo mode in this game is absolutely not worth your time - it barely resembles the real game. Two players is fine, if a little 'quiet'. The game really starts to sing at three and four, and at five I think you'll have tipped over to the other side of goodness. I'm not against having a game that works best at three or four, but I would definitely stay away of you primarily intend to play it solo or 2P. While still fun as an experience, I don't think this game offers enough to people mostly playing at a low player count. 

So, with all that said, where do we land on Wormholes? I churn through games pretty aggressively (for example, I've sold and replaced about 1/3rd of my collection so far this year), but I am gladly hanging onto Wormholes. The gameplay loop and game arc feel satisfying and the game looks and feels gorgeous. It's a lovely, inviting and light game that I think will be a bit with groups of three or four looking to have a fun, zoomy and quick time together. However, I'm not really going to pull it out as a dueler and I can't imagine this turning into anyone's favourite game or even game of the year. Grab it for groups looking to have quick fun sort of working together and flying through space.",,4,,20,mage-knight,public

##FAQ

**I live in Costa Rica/Canada/Ecuador/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now I cnat spel amymor!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on two ducks and a tube of lube, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

boardgames,Thoughts on roll and writes?,False,0,0,"Specifically flip and writes I think. I’m a big fan of cartographers and welcome to. Thinking of also getting long shot. 

What I enjoy about them is how adaptable they are and you can play with 1-12 relatively easily. This means it gets to hit the table all the time rather than a game like secret Hitler (which is amazing) but only gets to hit the table once every month rather than 3 times a week. 

Are there any other games in this genre you guys would recommend or perhaps even a criticism of the genre would be greatly appreciated.",,32,,0,,public
boardgames,can't remember name of a fun game I played,False,5,0,"About 3 years ago, I was winery hopping with friends in southeast Arizona (Sonoita) and at one of the stops we met a man who pulled out a game with colored playing pieces. He told us the rules, they were very simple. It's multiplayer: 4 ppl played first, then 3 ppl. It was HIGHLY addictive, very fast to play, and easy to develop your own strategy. I'm so sorry that is all I remember with confidence, but here are other details that are fuzzy:

It's some kind of winner-take-all game where the goal is to collect all of your colored pieces (or one of each color??) or cards - likely -  or else get rid of all your pieces or cards (less likely).

I think there was some element of chance as with dice or dealt cards, or both. The dice/cards may have been colored.

There was opportunity to adopt and try out strategies, a way to approach how you would conduct each turn. But strategy options were simple and limited.

I think it was played in one round (as opposed to phase 10 which takes many rounds). It was relatively fast to play, 5-10 minutes. I think it was played in turns. There was no scoring, pretty sure.

It was fairly compact and portable. I mean, the guy was basically taking it from winery to winery on a wine tour bus, and able to play it with strangers on a small picnic table.

I don't remember if it had a board, like a cardboard playing surface, or a wooden pegboard as you might put pegs onto. It might have.

I expect a lot of down votes for this. I'm basically describing every game in the history of games. I'm confident  that I would recognize it by its name, or a photograph, or even a description of gameplay. I'm not an avid/expert board game player, but I have played IMHO a large variety of games and I had never seen this before.

Any takers?",,9,,5,,public
boardgames,Question for Dominion collectors: do you still play the game the more expansions you own?,False,12,0,"I was a huge dominion fan for several years and played often. For most of that time I cycled around two expansions: dark ages and intrigue. I got a lot of mileage out of those two expansions. Then I started ‘collecting’ dominion. I have almost all of the expansions to date now and have figured out a storage solution to house all of them (wooden artist box). At this point however, the game is so huge and heavy it sits around unplayed way more than it used to. I’ve played the game several times since where I mix in all the expansions, but the games aren’t as interesting to me. I feel like dominion works best when you’re only playing with one or two expansions at a time.

I’m just wondering for the folks who’ve ended up collecting all the expansions, do you still play dominion frequently? 

I recently got one of those quiver card carrying cases and I’m thinking of just using that to have two expansions out at anytime to play the game. There’s something about having all of the expansions that makes the game feel less inviting.",,8,,12,,public
boardgames,Terraformig mars expansions question,False,17,0,"Hey lovely fellaz!

&amp;#x200B;

We started to play TM this weekend, only the basic version and we have a hell of a time with it. Now i am thinking about getting some of the expansions. My question is what you think about what i think :)

&amp;#x200B;

So i thinking about getting Prelude as its recommended like in all YT reviews. I want to get Hellas and Elyssium for case we want to change our map. And the third expansion i am thinking to get is Colonies to add more stuff to game.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to skip Venus next as i watched some reviews and from what a heard there, a lot of time its not worth time/effort and maybe keeping players from the focus on terraforming mars. Another one i want to skip is Turmoil because we are far from good at this game (on the box there is 90-120 minutes, we went for 4 hours per first games - yea we were drinking a bit but not much :). If i am not mistaken Turmoil adds and complicated the game lil bit more than we feel its right after 4 games played.

&amp;#x200B;

Also i have option to get the promo player boards that were part of Turmoil kickstarter edition, so i am getting these just for pure comfort while playing.

&amp;#x200B;

So if anybody more exprienced as me can advice me if my idea is good or should i change somethin i ll highly appreciate it and any other opinions :)

boardgames,Kickstarter games that would improve by being less premium,False,183,0,"Final Girl is my pick. It's my most expensive game at $300. As an all-in backer of both KS, I regret going all in. I love the game but I think this game is one of the biggest victims of KS bloat. It's all style over substance. It's a relatively light 30 minute solo game at its core. But everything is made to seem grander than it is.

The VHS-style boxes add a ton of time to setup and cleanup. You need 2-3 boxes for a game. And if you use the killer and location from the same box, you have to remove all of the contents and turn the box up-side down because the location and killer are on different sides and the covers are used as the boards. And the amount of content in the in the boxes isn't a lot. Hans for example has 23 normal-sized cards and the killer board. Camp Happy Trails has 8 normal-sized cards, 33 mini-cards, 6 tokens, and the location board. The production goes against the type of game it is. If the location and killer boards were on cardstock or cardboard, you could consolidate the game into one bigger box that would make setup and teardown so much easier. For quick games, a fast setup and teardown is important because a third of your time with the game shouldn't be spent on those things.

I get it, the VHS-style boxes add a ton of shelf presence. But let's talk about table presence for a moment. Everything from the KS reduces from it. Minis don't serve the game well. The play area is tiny and it's not right in front of you. It's only about 8-1/8 x 5-7/8in. The locations typically start with 8-12 victims and more can be added with events. That's already a decent amount of meeples for the area. But they're bright yellow. You might also have the blue, white, and yellow special victims. Then you have a bigger red meeple for the killer and a bigger purple meeple for the final girl. You might have tokens for items vehicles and minions. The vignettes don't have killers but use tokens for the bird and zombie minions. When you consider the small space and the distance from you, it actually does a good job at being easily readable. But when you add minis, you're just adding a bunch of grey to an otherwise colorful game. They also take up more space on the small board. It just reduces clarity and makes things harder to see. Series 2 is adding vehicle minis and minion minis for the vignettes so there could be more grey.

The minis are optional. But let's say you backed the KS and didn't get the minis. You still would spend $180. And if you didn't back the 1st campaign. The gameplay all-in on the 2nd campaign is $210. It doesn't feel like a $180 game and it's definitely not a $300 game. In terms of true solo games, it's tied at #1 for me. But I find it hard to recommend because while the gameplay and theme are stellar, it feels like a horrible value. I realize that the big production of the game is what attracts a lot of people to the game. It wouldn't have the same buzz without the premium-ness. I can't help but think it hurts the actual game.

What other games do you think suffer due to the trend of making everything premium?",,159,,183,,public
boardgames,Eclipse 2nd dawn rules question,False,5,0,"If a player moves a ship into a sector occupied by an opponent but the opponent has no ships there (the opponent has just an influence disc in the sector) does it count as a battle?  If it counts as a battle then both players would receive a reputation tile.

It doesn't feel right but the rulebook says ' A battle takes place if a Sector is occupied by more than one opponent (player or non-player such as Ancients, Guardians, or the GCDS).'.

So what is the definition of occupy?  A ship or an influence disc?  If it is a ship then you need more than a single ship to have a battle.  If its just an influence disc then it counts as a battle as the sector is 'occupied' by more than one opponent.",,8,,5,,public

boardgames,Card games similar to Magic but last a lot longer?,False,55,0,"My wife and I recently got into Dice Throne and enjoyed it quite a bit. We start with 50-75 life (I think 50 is standard but we like longer games). Either way games with the randomness of dice and decesion making take at least a good 30 minutes. There's a ton of back and forth usually and it feels like a battle. That being said we have most of the characters and were craving something a bit more complex, a bit more variety so we looked into MTG.

Long story short I played Magic 20 years ago and playing competitive with my wife in DT we got interested in Magic. We got started decks, nothing crazy powerful. We are having some fun... but I don't recall the game being so 'quick'. I guess that is the idea, but even with a few decks we are getting bored. There's a little back and forth and again we are not optimized and learning but we've had a few games go into turn 10+ though it seems pointlesss since you end up with tons of land but not many or no cards left in your hand to actually play since the game went on too long, but that is 20% of games. Most games seem over by turn 6 or close too it.

Looking online it seems like most MTG games are shorter at least from stats I read. I dunno know to me 15 minutes into a game turn 6 or 7 is where I want the game to get interesting and not be ending. Now  I understand the quickier games are over for Magic the quicker you see the same stuff/cards/decks and the more you want to make them... but wee don't have to much interest in making 20 different decks to use together (I know some products make that easy).

I guess long story short the structure of MTG makes games feel over as soon as they get going. What other games offer something longer and more like a 'battle' between two people?

Question: Does Cemetery only reveal the top 4 cards of the discard, with the necessity that the sequence can never be disrupted? That is, if you discarded them, you need to remember what they were and when to pull the trigger? I would assume this is the case and that there's no shuffling/randomization baked into the action of the word ""reveal.""

ANSWERED 
Question 2: When changing seasons, it's unclear who goes first for the next season. The way we played, it was the player directly clockwise from whoever took the ""prepare"" action last. In this way, the player who took the most actions in later seasons must go last at a catch up mechanic. Is this how you play?

ANSWERED
Finally, the rulebook says players who have finished the game cannot receive resources. The FAQ also says players who have finished can still have their buildings used (eg post office).

boardgames,My Favorite Catan House Rule,False,3,0,"Catan is a relatively simple game where the objective is to score 10 victory points by building settlements, cities, or aquiring Longest Road or Largest army bonuses.

In the base game, the ends immediately as soon as someone hits 10 victory points. This makes it possible to cheese a victory. Someone at 6 victory points can potentially get lucky with the rolls leading up to their turn, and manage to build multiple roads and play a knight, claiming longest road and largest army all in the same turn.

While many people may like this style of gameplay, I find for me and the groups I usually play with, it leads to an unsatisfying end to the game.

Hence, the **House Rule:**

It is incredibly simple, and **only changes one rule.** You may declare victory on your turn as soon as you reach 10 or more victory points as usual. However, **after you declare victory, you must maintain your lead for a full round.** Meaning, it must get all the way back to your turn, and you must still have the most victory points.

The other players can prevent your victory by taking ""Largest Army"" or ""Longest Road"" from the lead player, or by exceeding them in points. (i.e. getting to 11 victory points when they only have 10) In the event of a tie in victory points, the player who declared first still wins when it gets back to their turn. Another player can only win if they get you below 10 victory points, or they **exceed** you in victory points. However, even if someone manages to exceed you in victory points, they must also maintain that lead until it gets to their turn again.

It creates a really fun end-game dynamic where all the players cooperate frantically to try and take down the top player, and also creates the interesting scenario where you must decide whether to reveal your hidden victory point development card now, or wait until you have a more secure position.

I quite enjoy playing this way, but, like any house rule, it will not be everyone's cup of tea. I'd love to hear other people's thoughts on this. Is it something you'd consider trying?",,22,,3,,public

boardgames,Hot takes on Essen Spiel 2022 hotness,False,141,0,"Hi all,

Last thursday was my sixth time at the Essen Spiel con. Employing some of the gained experience (intended time of arrival, parking place, entrance, plan for the day), we managed to snatch everything on our wish list, which coincidentally overlaps a lot with the BGG hotness. I wanted to share some of my hot takes on these games with you after our first plays since.

Some general remarks:

\- I am a true euro gamer, some favorites include Feast for Odin, Brass, Concordia.

\- English is not my first language.

\- These are HOT TAKES, not reviews! All games may evolve at multiple plays, player counts, states of mind, etc.

**Maui**

We played this family weight tile-laying game with 2P at the convention and had high hopes due to the combination of publisher (Next Move Games), artist (Chris Quilliams) and designer team (known from Jaipur, Botanik and more). 

I'll cut to the chase, this play was a disappointment. The production is very average and some components are straight up bad for a retail price of 35 euros (I'm looking at you, flimsy single sheet cardboard boards). While the art is cute and mellow, it is also very repetitive. Finally, gameplay wise, it was fine. The core mechanism is choosing towels to make color matches, to advance on generic point tracks. There is some strategy involved in the 'direction' you want to move up and down the board as you can pick up little bonuses on the beach (again, pretty boring set collection). I found the little economic sand dollar mechanism mostly frustrating, and my overall feeling was that this game would get old very quickly. However, it plays in 15 to 20 minutes and there is a variant included which I have not played that might add some depth. Not for me, might be fun for families and kids.

**Heat: pedal to the metal**

Very anticipated game since we all like Flamme Rouge. Played this 4P at the hotel, just 1 race on the USA map without any of the modules. It played very snappy, and the race took us 30 minutes. First impressions are very good, and this is the game I have been thinking about the most since playing it. There is a cool game of chicken going on around the corner/slip stream mechanic, and the push your luck of boosting fits right in. However, I am happy that there are different modules included, since the base game is very.. basic. A little less going on than in base Flamme Rouge as you pilot 1 car instead of 2. The price is justified since the modules/content is plenty and production is top notch, in Days of Wonder fashion. Anyway, can't wait to play a championship with all modules next week!

**Astra**

Played this yesterday at home with 3P. Did not read into this game at all. I think it's Mindclashes first family weight game You fill in stars on different constellation cards in a communal tableau using dry erase markers, and the person who finishes a constellation gets to keep it and use the card for its special power and a set collection end game scoring. People who contributed get to choose a boon. When you run out of stardust which is used to mark off stars, you take a rest action. I found a part of the rest action very annoying, since you get to refresh your acquired and used cards, but only if the elements depicted match the one on the main bord. But you have no agency over the displayed element; it just rotates clockwise between 4 types, after every other rest action. 

Overall, it did not feel like there were many interesting choices to be made and I felt little enjoyment going through the motions. At least it didn't take long (30-45 minutes). Components are good, but I don't get why we have to dry-erase instead of just having player colored stardust to be placed on the cards. It's always a bit messy with dry-erase markers.

**The Great Split**

4P game at the hotel. This game is slick and stylish as heck, and pictures certainly don't do the foil / metallic elements and excellent recessed played boards justice. It is a pretty light game, I would say slightly above Ticket to Ride weight. Everything revolves around the titular I split/you choose mechanism, which fuels an array of goods/contract tracks. Every track has it's own way of scoring, and they are all interesting and viable. There is more player interaction than expected, as it is imperative to keep track of you neighboards when you decide how to make your own split, which you hand to the left, and the split you get to decide on, which you get from the right. After the first round this game played very snappy (&lt;45 minutes) and overall left a great impression on us all. With the setup and scoring variability included, I think this will be an excellent filler, and also a very interesting welcoming game for new players. The only problem that comes to mind is one similar to Puerto Rico; an experienced/good player receiving splits from a newbie/bad player will probably have an edge for the whole game, as you go clockwise for the whole game. However, for this weight and lenght this isn't a problem for me personally.

**King of Monster Island**

Co-op King of Tokyo / New York sounded like a recipe for succes for me - I like these games, but my wife strongly dislikes the negative interaction and player elimination. Played this at 2P (with wife) and had a blast. The production is amazing, with usual vibrant King of \*\*\* art, chunky dice, fun cards and now also a volcano dice tower! The easiest scenario (Crystal Dragon on easy side) was not much of a challenge, but the game totally delivers the King of \*\*\* experience in co-op mode, with wacky powers, unpredictable events and big turns that make you feel awesome. I did not have a light weight dice chucking 30-45 minutes co-op experience yet, and this fits that category perfectly.

**Flamecraft**

Cuteness overload, played with 4P at hotel. This was the last game we played that night, and were a bit tired, and it took us a bit longer than 60 minutes. First of all, the value of this game is INCREDIBLE (I am talking about the standard, non-deluxe 35 euro version). Amazing artwork, neoprene playmat, large high quality cards, screen printed player dragon meeples; just hold this game next to Maui, and you will scratch your head how they can have the same price tag. The game itself is a clever action selection / resource gathering / contract fullfillment game with fun positive player interaction, as shops get progressively better, and you get the feeling of building the city up together. One of the artisan dragons (which got played frequently) lets you gift resources to other players for points! There is also plenty of variability in shops, fancy dragons and helpers, so replay value seems good at first glance. Overall, loved it! A good vibes family-plus weight game. Might be troublesome for very analysis paralysis prone players, as there is a lot of different stuff to do, and the choices open up even more as the game progresses.

**Atiwa**

I am a BIG Uwe fan, and was super pumped for this one. To our surprise, Atiwa is pretty different to his other farming themed games; it certainly is not the next Agricola/Caverna. Tip for new players/teachers: include a dummy first round of the game, since I found it hard to wrap my head around the game flow after hearing the rules explanation. But, after the first round it all clicked. We finished it in 60 minutes at 2P.

This game has an intriguing ecosystem of animals, trees, fruit and fruit bats which ties in beautifully with the core worker placement mechanism. I like that you can't aquire more workers, like in Nusfjord and Ora et Labora you play with 3 each round of the game (because in Uwe games that let you get more workers, it usually is the easiest path to victory). The art and production are fine and what you expect from Lookout. Concluding, I enjoyed the first play very much. However, I am worried whether this game has legs so to speak. There are limited ways to earn victory points and the breeding mechanism is dictated by the same prerequisites each round. It feels very inefficient to not work towards these prerequisites, as it literally gives you free stuff, and the amount of actions you can take is limited (to 3 workers time 7 rounds). We will see.

**Lacrimosa**

Maybe THE hottest Essen Spiel 2022 game? The queue for Devir was the longest one for sure :). Played two times already, at 2P and 3P. Long story short, it lives up to the hype. A very expensive game at 70 euros, but even the box in shrink screamed 'premium', and after opening it I think the price is justified. Stunning artwork, way better in person than on pictures, and every component is top-notch and designed with a purpose.

I will not delve into the mechanisms as Candice Harris wrote a wonderful in depth preview on BGG which I highly recommend: [https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/136882/spiel-22-preview-finish-mozarts-requiem-lacrimosa](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/136882/spiel-22-preview-finish-mozarts-requiem-lacrimosa)

We all loved it. The game is heavy, but plays very smoothly and is laid out intuitively. All necessary information can be found on the board / components, and ultimately every turns boils down to picking 1 card for it's action and 1 for it's income from a selection of 4. There is subtle interaction in all sections of the board; memory cards and opus cards you eyeball/work towards might get snatched, the travel mechanism uses a shared pawn which means locations you want to visit might get snatched or you move further away from them, and the masterpiece commissions are an area control game between 2 composers you can support. At 2, the game was pretty mellow and a bit more loose, but at 3 there was already plenty of competition for the best cards/spots/commissions. I imagine that the 4P game can get cutthroat and you have to pivot your plans even more often. Out of all games played, this one impressed me the most, and I look forward to explore it further at all player counts and solo.

**Crossing Oceans - sorry, this is a bit of a rant**

Last and sadly least, my biggest disappointment of this Spiel. Concordia is a 10/10 game for me and I cherish my copy, singed by Mac Gerdts himself, blinged out with all expansions, maps and insert. This game.. is not that. I bought Transatlantic the year it released and thought it was fine. I sold it after a couple of plays as Concordia gave me a similar experience, but better. This game was supposed to be Transatlantic 2. I have to report that this is not even a 1.5 version, and in my opinion a huge step backwards. I seriously wonder why and how 5 years of development were necessary to arrive at this stripped down, worse Transatlantic. Played at home at 2P.

More than 75% of the components are literally Transatlantic components. There is also an upgrade pack available to convert your game to Crossing Oceans, point for PD Verlag for that. The components, and the artwork (I think only the main board has artwork that is new compared to Transatlantic), are servicable. I hate the paper money.

The game removes the Concordia-like cardplay and replaces it with a rondel. A very BORING rondel. In the process, like half of the actions from Transatlantic got removed, and certainly the more interesting actions. Furthermore, you can't see what the actions do anywhere? There were player aids mentioned in the rulebook, but they are not listed on the components list, and are most certainly not included in the box. Very bad decision, as now the rulebook has to be kept at hand for at least a couple of rounds of the game.

Furthermore, not only actions got cut, but also scoring opportunities. You just score for money, pieces on the board, and a set collection mechanism of boats multiplied by 5 tracks on the player board. No more scoring for rows, no more scoring during the game.

The result of all this? A game that is boring, has a clear 'best action' each round, and kind of plays itself. I have 3 green boats, what do I do? I max the green tradehouses. I have maxed out my green tradehouses, what do I do? I buy as many green/wild boats/docks as possible since they score 10 points each. Now I have no money, so I play the actions that earns me the most money. Rinse and repeat. I never felt smart playing this game and was done halfway, but, it dragged on (about 90 minutes). Oh, and to make matters worse, the weirdest end game mechanism makes the game drag on even LONGER! After the deck runs out all players have not one, but 3 more actions to go through. Never again.

Mac, I hope you can now let the steam boat theme go, and focus on something new..

\---

I hope this was informative for some of you, and remember, these are subjective opinions based on first plays!

Anyway, what are your thoughts on these games? Do you have any additional questions?",,17,,141,concordia,public

We play at a cafe so I am not exagerating when I say I ordered a meal, waited for it to be cooked and ate it yet it still wasn't ny turn. We were playing 4 player Root...

Every other member seem to take their time vocally narrating their thoughts and every possible out come and I am the only one seem to be bothered by it. I attemted to address it but I got told off and they ""won't rush their turns and risk losing"".

boardgames,Your Boardgames,False,11,0,"Earlier this year, I moved into a flat that has a lot less space than my previous house. This meant I had to cull some possessions. My boardgame collection was quite large, for a casual gamer, and contained a number of games that either rarely saw the table or had never been played. I therefore decided to sell some to local game stores for their ""Stay &amp; Play"" areas. 

This got me thinking: I much prefer having a smaller, refined collection of games that get played more frequently as this makes me feel like I'm getting my money's worth and also means I'm more likely to remember the rules! I also like the fact that my collection is now a reflection of me. These thoughts have definitely informed how and what I buy now. 

I'm just curious what approach others take to cultivating a collection. What matters to you when you look at your gaming shelf?",,20,,11,,public

##FAQ

**I live in Peru/Canada/Jamaica/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the fundamental democratic values of my county are falling apart!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on this growing new thing called LSD, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

Upon doing a little research I found that these two people filed hundreds of cases against game stores  and companies nationwide.

Anthony Toro and Jasmine Toro are the two parties involved in the filings.

So far they've sued Crafty Games of Washington, Games of Berkeley in California, Black Rowan Games in Tracy, California, GMT Games in Hanford, California,  GameScape North in San Rafael, California, GameKastle and more.

They're not really looking to see if these sites are compliant, they're simply sending out demands for settlement.  Regardless, if you own a game store, or know of one, let them know to get their site tested immediately for ADA compliance, hire a company to handle the lawsuit when/if it comes, or simplify their site in such a way as to make it ADA compliant.

We're losing our gaming spaces and friends in the community to these trolls.  These people have no intentions of making the world better for disabled people, they're only looking to make money.

boardgames,Clank! Replayability without expansions. Suggestions.,False,9,0,"Hi! I leave in Brazil. Clank! was released here a long time ago and was never reprinted. I don't even know if the expansions were released here. Recently I travelled to the US and after years trying to geet this game, I finally bought one (usually pople charge 3x de value for this type of out of print games here).

My group and I loved the game! It's so easy to teach, set up and play. The first time we playerd 4 times in a row.

But I'm already afraid of the low replayability of the base game. We tried the Companium App that adds the Lieutenant, but it's too dam random... 70% of the time nothing happens, and when happens it's not even guaranteed if you are the one that will get screwed, if everyone will get screwed, or if everyone except you will get screwed.... The game have already enough randomization at it is, we didn'y like the Lieutenant... But the Companion for points and setup it awesome.

As I leave in Brazil, I don't really have the option of buying expansions to get extra cards and maps. What are the options to get more replayability out of this game? I'm trying to find game board images to print, but I'm not being able to find any.

Any suggestions?",,10,,9,,public

boardgames,Discussion on writing in board games.,False,6,0,"I don't mean rulebook writing but all the other writing;  what you read in game intros, flavor text, text based games, books published related to a game, apps, and so forth.

What writing had been memorable to you?

**Galaxy Trucker** is probably the one that sticks out most, especially because the flavor text in the rulebook helps reinforce the rules, which you may have used when explaining the game to newcomers.

Mixing flavor text with the gameplay; somewhere out there Ben Croshaw is cracking a smile.

Shout out to the Rocky Road novel as well!  The whole truck driver scam chapter felt like a lost Douglas Adams notebook.

**Mice and Mystics** was rather enjoyable.   Especially the chapter midway in the book where all heck breaks loose and every game mechanic dumps into the same battleground!    I can still picture what was happening in my head.

Sadly, that is all that stands out to me.

---

Is it me or does good writing in board games feel lacking?   Of course this opinion is coming from me, someone who has no experience with writing and ""more of a math guy"".

FFG in particular all feels, well, bland. 

I skip the flavor text on Arkham games after 10 years of seeing them.   Descent 1st and 2nd edition felt like fantasy templates to copy and paste.

The Hour of the Huntress, one of many in the Asmodee library of stories, just didn't interest me enough to read any of the other board game novels like Arkham, or the Terraforming Mars novel.  Has anyone read that book?

Oh and the apps.   Destinies gets some points for some silly things like arm wrestling the king of Bavaria but all these app games are like ""you need to find a mushroom.  You fail to find the mushroom.  There is a door instead, the door has a sturdy lock and you can't just hit it with your axe you started the game with.  That would be rude"".

Now of course what players themselves come up with will be far more entertaining amongst themselves.   How many of you picture Jenny Barnes as a Duel weilding John Woo badass who don't take no sass?  Who imagines the jock from Betrayal at House on the Hill whose battle cry is shouting FOOTBALL before punching a monster right in the face?

Maybe that is the goal?  Less effort on flavor, more effort on a blank slate for the player to fill?

Video games today however are a joy to read, with indie titles like Outrr Wilds, Disco Elysium,  or anything by Greg Casavan to name a few.  Could quality like this be transferred to board games?

Story-wise: My daughter loves games with story. Recently been playing Destinies with her. 

Gameplay: Boardgame stories are so generic to me they rarely keep my interest so I need to enjoy the gameplay. I do however enjoy art and setting. (Bought many a game based on “oh that looks cool as hell”) As with Destinies I enjoy it for most part, but such little actual “gameplay.”

Length of Game:  I know these are campaign games, but how long is each session. We are talking a teenager with a short attention span unless it’s staring at a phone.

\- 5 or 6 players, with one player taking the ""alien"" side, the rest taking the ""crew"" side

\- 5-7 ""locations"". Each player must pick a location each turn, and if the ""alien"" player chooses the same one as at least one of the ""crew"" players, some sort of ""meter"" goes down (or up, when it reaches max the alien player wins IIRC.)

\- There were some special abilities/tasks/benefits that were unique to each location. IIRC the alien also had some special abilities.

\- The game lasts for a few rounds. If the crew side manages to finish their objectives at the locations, they win; otherwise, the alien wins if time runs out or they manage to catch enough crew members enough times.

boardgames,WSBG Vegas 2022 Review or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Fact that Nobody Knows WTF is Going On,False,227,0,"a short (?), sweet (??), and scathing (!!!) review of my experience in Vegas...

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday: there are two Ring Events this night, 7 Wonders and Splendor; so far, so good, everything seems fairly well-conducted. I check in at the desk at the front of the Tournament Hall and I am given my table and my seat number, all is well and the night proceeds...

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday: my Ring Event this day is Wingspan, 9a start time - I check in at the front desk and I am given my table and my seat number. The ""player board"" tournament template that was introduced by the WSBG organizers started to be exercised, and it gave me some measure of confidence in their interest in conducting a fair and structured event. However, I noted at this time that there was no common game clock: games started when they were ready, and neither judges nor tournament procedures were ever introduced. When we needed assistance it was necessary for somebody from our table to get up and seek out somebody that looked like they might be a ""judge"" (???). Surprisingly, during our first game we were told by somebody who looked like a judge that we had \*\* 4 hours \*\* to complete the first round -&gt; this loose time control will come in to play again later in this review...

&amp;#x200B;

Friday (the cracks begin to show): As I did for the previous two events, I went to the front desk to check in. Somebody who ""looked like a judge"" (recall nobody has ever been formally introduced, they can only be recognized by standing in the right place at the right time wearing what looks like the right shirt) told me to ""go to the back corner of the hall"" for my game. I did so, and then somebody else wearing the right shirt asked me ""did you check in?"" -&gt; to which of course I responded ""no, I was told to come over here"". He then told me to go back to the front desk and check in... so back to the front desk I went, where I was admonished, yelled at and asked ""who told you to come up here? go back to the corner!"" -&gt; ???. I return to the back corner of the hall, somebody new wearing the right shirt shows up and tells everybody to find their name and seat number on a placard on one of the 7 tables and prepare for their game. After everybody finds their seat there are over a dozen players still milling about, confused that they have not been seated. The tournament organizer (?) that I previously mentioned starts reading names, covering all of the players who have not yet been seated, and tells them to step aside and be seated at another group of tables. Then, we are instructed to begin our round when we are ready. It seems like a rather small field, and then we come to find out: of the \~40 players that signed up for the event, for some reason \*\* 13 \*\* players were given a first round bye!! What was supposed to be a 4 round Ring Event (where the winner advances to Sunday's semifinals) was now at best a 3 round event where 1/3 of the field was given a first round bye...

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday, the final day of Ring Events: Dune Imperium

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;&lt; the degraded experience as the days went by prepared me for the s#!t show that was to come, and I was not disappointed &gt;&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Dune: Imperium -&gt; a sold out event (1 of maybe 2?) and arguably the crown jewel of the tournament given the game's popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

The first round was scheduled to start at 3p (already rescheduled twice) and when I arrived to check in I found the doors to the tournament hall closed. I opened the door and walked to the check-in desk.

&amp;#x200B;

“What game are you here for?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Dune”

&amp;#x200B;

“Game start has been delayed, please wait outside the hall and we’ll call you in when we’re ready for you”

&amp;#x200B;

...a sign on the door would have been helpful, but instead they had to make this same statement to at least 30 other people that opened the doors and went inside over the next 45 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

\~45 minutes later somebody wearing what looks like the right shirt comes out and instructs us to start lining up for check-in, again this game is sold out so we’ve got 256 players to get seated at 64 tables.

&amp;#x200B;

Check-in is complete, everybody is seated, but nobody has come around to instruct us how to proceed. After a few more minutes my table decides to reach out to the table next to us and swap game copies with them so we can start getting set up (recall: everybody had to bring their own copy of the game for the Ring Events that they signed up for, and you couldn’t play with your own copy so swapping like this is how it usually went; also note that fewer than half of the players at my tables actually brought copies of the game, so who exactly were these instructions for??).

&amp;#x200B;

My table is all set up, we're chatting, I have a good group of players and I’m feeling like this is going to be an enjoyable session... some more time passes and it looks like literally nobody is in control, besides being given table and seat numbers at check-in we have not received any instruction, so I get up to go find somebody who looks like they are wearing the right shirt to ask when we are starting the round and was told “oh, if you’re ready start now” grrrrr... so we did.

&amp;#x200B;

As the first round of the game starts we are all being very deliberate and taking our time, making sure that we all understand the ""player board"" template rules and deciding upon the conventions we want to establish for ""pieces played / cards laid"" etc. -- During this round a player at our table brings up a rules question and offers what they think the answer is; I agree and I am ready to continue the game, esp. as the question has nothing to do with anything currently happening on the board and was more “what if” based, but 2 other players didn’t agree with the interpretation and wanted a judge ruling at that moment. So our table calls for a judge, one comes over and discusses the rules and chats about where to find a valid ruling as they search through print-outs (rule book vs. published errata vs. BGG Dennen posts etc.) and just generally wastes time that didn’t need to be used at the moment, but whatever... 25 minutes or so go by and we get back to the game and we finish the first round of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

We start the second round of the game and another rules question comes up re: “are discard piles open information?”. I answer “yes of course they are”, a player at our table disagrees and wants a ruling, and this one I’m happy to get officially resolved since it should be quick \*\*and\*\* I know I’m right \*\*and\*\* I intend on using this during the game. A judge comes over and tells us “no, discard piles are not open information” ?!!?. I ask for them to bring another judge over, and after some rule book and errata investigation (along with more unnecessary casual chatting) the second judge decided to rule that “you can look through your own discard pile but not your opponent’s”, arghhhhhh !!!! To which I replied “if that is the ruling that you’re going to hold us to you are going to have a room full of very upset players, because every other player here knows that discard piles are absolutely open information” - but that was that, the ruling was made and we continued our game (another 20+ minutes spent on this unsatisfactorily resolved matter).

&amp;#x200B;

\^ not 10 minutes later I overhear the same question come up at a table in the next row, somebody who looks like a judge appears and immediately rules for that table that “yes, discard piles are open information”... so I guess there’s just different rules at each table ??

&amp;#x200B;

My table begins the third round of the game (for those unfamiliar, this game usually runs 8-9 rounds of play), we are finally looking like all of the B.S. might be behind us and we can get on with playing the game - halfway through the round one of the judges (the same from our first “rules question”) comes over to say “you have less than 40 minutes to finish your game” —— WAT

&amp;#x200B;

“the round ends @ 5:30”

&amp;#x200B;

How can that be, I ask? The round started late, and in fact every table started at different times since nobody told us when to start or what the time controls would be (recall we had 4 HOURS for our 1st round of Wingspan, so it never crossed my mind that time would be an issue here) - in addition, at least 45 minutes of our game time thus far had been wasted by judges who didn’t know what they were doing and seemingly had no problem taking their time and chatting us up using our game time !!

&amp;#x200B;

But that was it, the game ends at 5:30, finish it up - so then everybody at the table tilts, players at my table start yelling at each other, everybody rushing for whatever scraps of points they can get before time runs out, misplays abound (myself included), it becomes a giant clusterF..

&amp;#x200B;

My table is at the beginning of round 7 of the game when the same judge comes by again to tell us “game ends in 10 minutes, at that time finish the round and declare a winner” - at least that’s what I heard, 2 other players at our table heard “game ends in 10 minutes, finish THIS round and declare a winner” which makes considerably less sense, why bother telling us how much time is left if we’re just supposed to finish the current round? So this needed another judge ruling / clarification (and this one was actually necessary, since this absolutely impacts play for the next set of turns) - a few more minutes are wasted, the judge that comes over can’t give us a decisive answer (??) so says “I will go get an answer for you, I’ll be right back” — which doesn’t really help...

&amp;#x200B;

Half of the players at our table want to continue the game in the meantime, certain that this was indeed the last round and playing for the points to make sure they can secure the lead until the end of the round; myself and another player believe we can finish this round and get to the next one before time is called, and of course we both want that ruling as it puts us in the position we want to be in... but in truth nobody knows for sure what is going on at this point, everything is FUBAR

&amp;#x200B;

The round ends, everybody has exhausted their resources / screwed up their plays / tried to position themselves to reach a win condition at the time that they \_believed\_ the game would end.

&amp;#x200B;

The judge comes back and says “don’t worry about the time, just finish the game to completion”.

&amp;#x200B;

...and all hell breaks loose, my table is about to be flipped, \_nobody\_ is happy about this, none of us have reserved the resources or the play options to successfully plan to play this out.

&amp;#x200B;

Each player in our game was convinced they would have won in a different round given a different ruling on when the game was supposed to end...

&amp;#x200B;

Time to breathe, reliving this as I typed it out was fairly traumatic... there is no world in which I would ever do this again with these rank amateurs, this event was so poorly conducted, I feel incredibly duped; they were in no way prepared to succeed at a venture at this scale, despite marketing themselves as if they were; the resources exist in the gaming community that would have made them successful, I do not understand why they did not take advantage of them.

&amp;#x200B;

boardgames,Stacking odd shaped pieces circa 2019,False,4,0,"Hey folks, I'm looking for a game that required players to stack odd shaped pieces in a tower. I *think* you drew a card instructing each player which piece to attempt to stack but I can't quite remember the mechanics.

I DO remember that the pieces were generally the size ofy fist at biggest, but mostly slightly smaller. They were plastic and the ""standard"" pieces were Grey while the ""special"" harder pieces were yellow. They were also deceptively weighted/balanced; for example a piece might look like a cone but on closer inspection has uneven angles or is heavier weighted on one side than the other.

Shapes ranged from an egg, to a goblet, to a cone, to some funky cubes/rectangles.

My wife swears the theme of the game involved a castle and gold. 

We played this with some friends circa 2019 and through googling I can confirm it is NOT the following games:
- Jenga/dread
- beasts of balance
- bandu
- junk art
- hippo hero

boardgames,Basic board game bag? (EU),False,1,0,"EDIT: should have made the title say *backpack* instead of *bag*.

For a while now I've been using a [standard Cajon backpack](https://www.thomann.de/de/sela_se_090_cajon_backpack.htm) to transport a larger amount of games on foot. For 30x30 game boxes or smaller, it's almost as perfect a vessel as can be, except the *slight* issue that it's not made with a 20kg load in mind (3-4 boxes with inserts and expansions and you can easily get there).

Which means that [disintegration](https://imgur.com/a/LCJHacu) is the inevitable result of using it for a while. Now, I'm prety sure this would not have happened if the stitched reinforcing straps went over the edge and connected with each other to distribute the pressure away from that edge, which is a real minor change. There are more expensive cajon bags around than €25, but they all seem to share this design issue of unrefinorced pressure points.

^(Side note: In my search I found several of) [^(these)](https://www.amazon.de/Brettspielen-GEPOLSTERT-Schultergurt-Au%C3%9Fentasche-ORGANISIEREN/dp/B07XG86K3Y/)^(, which seems like the standard cajon bag but rebranded as a game bag with a 100%+ markup.

There's plenty of classical solutions like IKEA bags or shoulder-strap sports bags, and also many [overengineered](https://www.amazon.de/ENHANCE-ZAINO-GIOCHI-TAVOLO-Rinforzata/dp/B07W7LFCRV) [overpriced](https://shop.level3b.com/collections/frontpage/products/the-game-canopy) [special](https://www.ebay.de/itm/202632385139?var=502709526100) board game bags, but my tentative conclusion is it seems best to buy a cheap cajon bag and pay a handbag repair shop €10-20 to reinforce the top edge. I'm just surprised given how easy a modification that is there don't seem to be any such items on the market in the corresponding \~€30 price range.

boardgames,[New to Clank!] Does Clank! have a first player balance issue?,False,4,0,"I finally bought Clank! last week, and everyone I played with loved it!

However, a common observation was the fact that usually the first player won. Out of 8 games I played with differenct groups, the first player won 7 times. And out of these 7 times, only once the difference between the highest and the second highest score was less than 10. 

Adding a single extra Clank! at the beginning of the game seems to be the only way to balance the first player advantage. Adding a single Clank! doesn't really seems to make any difference, comparing with the advantages of moving first, and cycle through your discard pile faster.

Some games like Viticulture automatically switch first players between rounds, while games like Champions of Midgard let you choose to waste a worker to be the first one next round.

boardgames,September victory - Pandemic Legacy Season 1,False,6,0,"&gt;!\[edit\] Adding another spoiler warning in case it shows up for some reason in previews as it did for at least one person.!&lt;

&gt;!Text follows.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Start:!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!After a BRUTAL first game in September where our Soldier was revealed to be the traitor and we flamed out spectacularly we picked ourselves up and tried again.  New member of the team - Anita the virologist who loathes the scientist, Fiona.  (Rivals)!&lt;

&gt;!We had an absolutely incredible start.  The one disease we'd fully 'upgraded', black, was not placed at all during the setup infection phase and we had sufficient black cards by turn 2 (scientist) to automatically cure it.  (She needs one fewer, the disease requires one fewer, and no action needed so when she drew her cards and got a third black on top of the two she had to start, it was done.) Amazing.!&lt;

&gt;!But then:  on turns 5, 9 and 13 the first player drew an epidemic card!  We were furiously trying to quarantine and/or remove faded figures - nearly the whole board has faded cities now - and just barely keeping it at bay.!&lt;

&gt;!Eventually we cure yellow, and get enough cards to the scientist - 4 - to cure red, but that's her final action so we have to survive one more go-round.  We've already sabotaged two bases, so all that's left is quarantining 7 cities, so that (plus preventing outbreaks) is our focus now.!&lt;

&gt;!With only I think five cards remaining we finally pull one of our funded events - we used two thanks to losing the previous match - and it was the one permitting the addition of two quarantine markers anywhere.  Incredible timing.!&lt;

&gt;!With that we just barely managed to get to the Scientist, luckily didn't get the fifth epidemic, and win.!&lt;

&gt;!Following the match we have: !&lt;

&gt;!18 cities stable 13 cities unstable 10 cities rioting 3 cities collapsing 4 cities fallen!&lt;

&gt;!Every continent has at least one Faded city except Asia. South America is in the best shape overall (no unstable cities, one faded).   We have no structures in North America any more; Europe has a few but is completely Faded, being the home of city zero (Essen).!&lt;

&gt;!Peeked ahead at October: looks like we're on the hunt for patient zero!  Thinking we need the operations specialist as we've lost a lot of structures to our own sabotage and of course rioters tearing down research labs!!&lt;

&gt;!Such a great game.  We're loving it.    Thirteen games over seven months to get to this point.!&lt;

&gt;!One thing I have found really interesting is that we are 50/50 win-loss with zero funded events in the deck.  Except our first game that we completely screwed up, we are 100% wins with any funded events in the deck.!&lt;

boardgames,Alternate way to end Lords of Vegas? Thoughts?,False,2,0,"So me and some friends all played Lords of Vegas for the first time last night. Fun game. But we didn’t love the mechanic of how the game ending was time based as opposed to score benchmark based. Now, we’ve only played it once, so I wanted to hear yalls opinions about this who have played it way more. The issue was one player was WAYYYY ahead as we approached the 3/4 mark, turning the game into a situation where there was no real chance of a comeback and thus greatly diminishing the fun for the last 4 turns or so. Is this a rarity? Is it just because we admittedly were playing pretty badly strategy wise since it was everyone’s first time? We were brainstorming about doing something like getting rid of the game over card and instead playing to a set number (70 or so) and then just going through the deck and reshuffling if we reached the end. Has anyone played like that before? Would love yalls thoughts on this. Thanks guys!",,14,,2,,public

boardgames,Good table under $1k?,False,29,0,"So I received my Jasper table last week, and it was riddled with issues unfortunately. So much so that I am actually returning the table. I won't go into details, and I know plenty of people have bought them without any issues, but unfortunately my experience wasn't the same.

I don't want to disparage Board Game Tables, they have been very kind and helpful in the return process and they are a small business, I'm sure getting tables to people across the US is difficult and I commend them for even trying. And I say take my experience with the Jasper with a grain of salt - after all, I did plenty of research before buying a Jasper and the sheer number of positive reviews made it seem like a really safe choice. And it definitely still is, I think I just got rather unlucky.

That experience made me rethink the entire concept of paying so much for a table. I decided paying a massive premium due to the niche nature of board game tables as a product just isn't worth the possible hassle if the QC/shipping gamble doesn't go your way. I was concerned about longevity of the table pretty much the moment I opened the box, which isn't promising from a $1.5k product. Again, this isn't the norm from my research, I just got unlucky.

Anyways: Anyone have any non-board-game table recs? Honestly I've just been looking at IKEA since I live close to one. Used to have a Bjursta from there that I actually quite liked, but sadly they discontinued that table it looks like. But I'm open to any recs from anywhere.

boardgames,"Weekend Play Report (3 new to me games, 2 oldies)",False,9,0,"My mother-in-law was up this past weekend so I was able to sneak off to a friends house for the weekend, at least until I was called back due to a sick child. I was able to fit in 8 games though, so not too bad for a trip. 4 were completely new (thought it was 3 when I wrote the subject, a rookie mistake), 2 were oldies, and two got played twice. Here's the breakdown:

1. Vengeance (Played at 2 players and 3 players)

The non-roll and write Vengeance was an absolute delight. It comes in 3 parts, a one-time set collection draft (which is later supplemented in other rounds but the draft happens only once), a dice draft and buy phase, and a roll and attack phase. Each part would be kind of meh, but the sum definitely exceeds the individual parts on their own. The decision of how much damage you take prior to going into a Den; the fun of taking turns where you turn a knife into a gun into a run into two knives and everyone is now dead; the laughs that come with each success and failure; its just all so good. Its one of the few games I found myself rooting for my opponents with each die roll. I will say two bad things about it though: 1) the Rulebook is absolutely terrible and 2) It was a bit more sloggy at 3 compared to 2, but not so much that I wouldn't play again at 3, I probably would pass at 4. Finally, I created the following head-cannon: This is a competitive game because all the vengeance-seekers are sitting at a bar recounting the story of their exploits, and the best story gets free drinks for the night from the others.

2. Street Masters (Played at 2 and 3)

Continuing the theme of beating people up, I found a copy of Street Masters (which was very very tough to do) since it was my friends Birthday and he loves Sentinels but has all that content. It was a good decision, because it played like a Sentinels tactics game, but not like Sentinels Tactics, which was a terrible game. Each turn you move, play a card, and activate a card (or move again, or interact, you get the point). Then the enemy and environment does some things, wash rinse repeat until enough things have been punched. It does feel at times the enemy minions become overwhelming, but we had a good time with it. We won the first at 2, lost when we later played at 3 after knocking out 2 of the bosses 3 health bars. The head-cannon here is if it says 25p (aka per player), each 25 health is a health bar. Of course this has absolutely no effect on gameplay, but if you're going to pretend to be in a side scrolling beat-em-up, you give the boss fake health bars.

3. Flamecraft (Played at 2)

Flamecraft was...fine. On the positives, the game is absolutely beautiful and it plays as a breezy worker placement game. Each turn you take your Dragon miniature, go to a shop, collect the resources showing and then activate a power there. Alternatively, you can go to a shop and cast an enchantment to activate every dragon there. So far so good. My issues are the following: 1) One Dragon seems insanely overpowered, the diamond dragon that lets you collect 3 different resources. Combined with the Potion dragon that swaps and uses and other dragon, we were constantly bouncing these diamond dragons around, filling our coffers with 6-9 resources after casting an enchantment. It seemed like every other dragon mattered much much less since you could use the diamond dragons to use enchantment turn after enchantment turn. 2) More problematic is the end game, where once end game is triggered, everyone gets 1 more turn. This leads to the situation that if first player triggers end game, they get one more turn than everyone else. Given there's not much differentiation between player turns, an extra turn is a huge huge advantage. I'm curious if anyone else had this issue, because it put a real sour taste in my mouth.

4. So Clover (2)

I'm curious why So Clover, when every other board game lists as wide of a player count as possible, when with a minimum 3 players on the box when it so easily plays at 2. We made our clovers, traded, filled out each others clovers, did the check round, and filled it out a second time. A quick fun time, and I will forever call shoes Sock Devices from now on.

5. Long Shot, the Dice Game (3)

The first non-new to me game, Long Shot continues to be fantastic. Roll the dice, place your bets, buy some horses, start yelling at the 6 horse for not moving forward for the 3rd turn in a row despite you betting the house on it WHY WONT YOU MOVE FORWARD. Anyway, the second play of this game, first at 3, and it once again came down to a neck and neck race for 3rd deciding the winner, which had everyone sweating and laughing around the table. Cant wait to play this one again.

6. Dominations (3)

Dominations is technically not new to me, but it came out right before the pandemic so this is an out of the dust play. I'm a huge fan of the game, so I was thankful to get it to the table. In this game, you place some tiles, collect your resources, and buy a tech which you add to a eventually quilt of cards. Honestly, Dominations should be called Tapestry and Tapestry should be called Dominations, but that's a discussion for another day. This game I went heavy on influence and eked out a 1 VP win (which is more impressive when you consider VP are usually 200-300+ points), 2nd place when a mix of monuments and end of age scoring, and third place was within 20 and went heavy monuments. The one drawback of the game is the massive amount of techs you can choose leading to possible AP or downtime. We dodge downtime by letting others go while someone choose a tech, but we had turns where someone would place a tech and then be told its their turn on the tile placement again. That should lessen the more you play the game though. Honestly, one of my favorite games I played this past year.

After Dominations I got called home to help with sick kids, so a few games like Clash of Cultures, Townsfolk Tussle or My City had to stay in the bad, but here's the Tl;Dr tier list:

Loved:

Long Shot

Dominations

Theme game nights - Zombies, Asian (one particular one included ones in origin like Xiang Qi and Go, while another was Asian themed so the likes of Gates of Loyang), IP games (e.g. Star Wars), epic long games (those that take over 3 hours to play), and 2p games (2p only, or games that do other player counts, but would only be played at 2p).

No, I didn't buy into that. :) 

But I did bring it up with the owner of my FLGS. We discussed the issues with renting board games and table space and providing food. At one point, he mentioned that while he wasn't looking to sell, if he did it would be to me.

I've known him since before he started his shop 10 years ago and he was my Best Man at my wedding a few years back. He and his wife have come to our house for drinks and gaming and we've been to theirs. So we have history.

We started the discussion then. What would it take? How much would you want? Hmmm.

My wife and I discussed it and we looked at our finances and opened serious discussions with him and his wife to see if there was interest. Turns out she was running the business part and he was running the retail part, dealing customers and ordering inventory. There was a third person doing the tech part. Trying out email campaigns, twitter, facebook, and shop gear. Her career was taking off and getting away from the business would let her focus more on her career. The tech guy also had a job and no investment in continuing the tech side of things (everything was pretty old or unused).

As time went on it firmed up and lawyers got involved to create the appropriate documentation. We got asset lists created including the things he wanted to keep. I applied for sales tax licenses for my LLC and we signed papers in August. As of September 1st, all of the assets of the store were mine. Note I didn't buy the LLC, just the assets of the shop which are all now under my LLC.

For the past month I've been taking over control of distributor accounts, facebook, twitter, google, and other accounts that had been started but never completed. I added accounts with game shops like Leder Games, Stonemaier, Steve Jackson, and CMON. Purchased a new computer for the POS. Upgraded the POS. Fixed the security systems. And done some rearrangement of the shop. I restarted board game night (Wednesday nights) and October is Halloween themed with Elder Sign tonight. My wife and I gamed every Wednesday. Now we just go to the shop Wednesday nights :) 

The shop didn't have much in the way of social media presence. I've upped the posting to Facebook and our engagement is over 300% over the past 30 days. I've posted a bit more to Twitter and now have 44 followers (it hadn't been posted to since 2015). I created a discord server that has 75 users after 6 weeks.

I've basically improved the presence but haven't made any changes to the running of the shop leaving it all to my manager. It's been a successful shop for 10 years so I have no reason to muck with that :)

Humorously I got a minor talking to because I was buying my own merch. He knows I'm a collector type and he wants me to let him know what I want as my purchases skews the desire for the product by customers.

In a few years I'll retire and take over the counter. Well, maybe. We'll see how the next couple of years shake out. I may be better at running the business and he needs a job :D

boardgames,A solo dungeon crawler round-up,False,29,0,"I have sunk an embarrassing amount of time into playing roguelike video games, along with dungeon crawlers. There's something about the challenge they promise along with the difficult but rewarding gameplay that really, truly draws me in. Since switching to playing more solo games I've been searching out different dungeon crawling board games so as to try and get that same experience from a tabletop game. Knowing that a number of people are in this together with me, I thought it might be fun to have a look at the games I've tried so far. Hop along, shall we?

I looked at the following games, arranged by after market prices:  
1. One-card Dungeon  
2. Tin Helm  
3. Mini Rogue  
4. Tiny Epic Dungeons  
5. Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion  
6. Space Hulk fourth edition  

And technically Mage Knight, more on that at the end.

What you'll notice is that I don't play very many massive affairs with long Kickstarter wait times and boxes full of miniatures. I'm finding it very difficult to explain to myself why I would buy a 100+ euro game without having absolute certainty that I will get enjoyment out of the game equal to the value that I've put into it. There's some games on this list (specifically Mage Knight and definitely Space Hulk) that most definitely fall into this category, but I could explain those purchases to myself. Mage Knight I bought second-hand for an excellent price before I dove into the Ultimate Edition, and I had played Space Hulk a ton of times before buying my own copy. What I'm saying is that a game has to do a lot more as a value proposition before I will consider buying it the more expensive it is. 

With that note out of the way, let's get started! 

**One Card Dungeon** - 3 plays
What is it:  
One Card Dungeon is pretty much what it says on the tin - a dungeon crawler that's played on a single card. Both players and enemies are dice being moved around, and your actions each turn come from you assigning dice values to your attributes. Make it through twelve dungeons (done by flipping and rotating the dungeon card) to win!  

Would I recommend it:   
Not really, or more as a novelty. One Card Dungeon is very impressively designed, mostly in that the designers managed to make the enemies in the game feel and behave differently from one another just by tweaking some numbers - it really is impressive. That said, I don't think the game has a lot of replay value after you've made it through a few runs. The dungeon lay-out is the same each time, which is not necessarily a big deal if it wasn't for the fact that you see each floor six times in a single run. Added to that is the fact that the dice-driven gameplay leads to a bunch of dead turns where you only really block and hope to find an attack die that does something next turn. It *is* cheap though, so it might just be worth it to you even if you only really get three plays out of it.  

**Tin Helm** - 7 plays  
What is it:   
Tin Helm is the mint tin version of Iron Helm, available only through the Game Crafters. You play as an adventurer delving through a dungeon in search of relic shards that help you break the curse that... Eminates from this place. You'll be combining the front of one card with the back of another to figure out what terrible stuff will befall you in this dungeon. Throw in some dice chucking and you've got a stew going, baby.  

Would I recommend it:   
Partially I would. I most like this game when the result of the flip is largely unknown. The tension in the game really started to dissipate once I started remembering which cards have things on them that give you shards. However, playing the game is a lot of fun! The dice play and stat management is a whole lot of fun, and the push your luck element of figuring out if a room is better as your destination or as the modifier was really clever. My current hope is that the creator figures out a way to make an expansion for this game like he did for Gate, because I'm definitely not tired of the system.   

**Mini Rogue** - 17 plays  
What is it:  
Mini Rogue is a roguelike dungeon crawler in which you explore different floors of either a tower or a dungeon, getting into fights with bosses along the way. Exploring is done by flipping cards on a 3x3 grid, and getting experience unlocks extra dice to use for checks and combat. Throw in a smattering of unique characters, and that's Mini Rogue!  

Would I recommend it:   
I would! Mini Rogue is about as much fun as you can get from a game this light. The characters and character powers are fun, the game is diverse enough and quick enough to get you into a game quickly and get back out, and the character progression feels real good. That said, I will admit that I tired of the base game after quite a few plays because I kept seeing the same few things over and over again. The expansion stuff for the game helped breathe new life into it for me (especially the new characters - that skeleton guy is rad as hell) but after the amount of plays I've had with it I'm looking for new things. That said, it's a very solid game. I've had a ton of fun with it.  

**Tiny Epic Dungeons** - 4 plays  
What is it:  
The Tiny Epic series is known for cramming a ton of game into a little box filled with stellar production values, and the same is true here. This box in particular has a large number of room tiles that you explore in a 7x7 grid space on the look for mini bosses before you can fight the main boss. Players will acquire loot along the way (including loot sets that grow more powerful the more pieces of the set you have) and pilot their heroes in a fight to beat the boss!  

Would I recommend it:    
This is a tough one for me. I personally like it, but the rules for the game are a bit of a mess and the heavy reliance on iconography makes the game hard to parce. I've never beaten the game so far (which I see as a good thing) but I've also consistently had the feeling that I wasn't playing correctly anyway. The boss fight mechanics are weird as heck and I keep forgetting to take damage whenever I reveal a tile with a monster on it. There's also some weird stuff going on with the expansion and the production of the game. I'm not entirely sure that I like the use of both meeples and miniatures in this game, mostly because the meeples look *so good*. The miniatures are not bad, but I'm not sure they add enough to the game. I more feel like they detract from the game rather than adding much; my suspicion is that they were added because many famous dungeon crawlers use minis and so now they feel they had to (looking at you, Gloomhaven). So, if you want a really tough solo or co-op game while being able to deal with weird production choices and unclear rules, I think you can have a lot of fun with this game. It really does have a LOT of game inside that small box.   

**Gloomhaven - Jaws of the Lion** - 9 plays  
What is it:  
Younger brother to the number one boardgame on BGG, Jaws of the Lion is a more streamlined and beginner friendly gateway to the Gloomhaven system. Players will pick a character and play through a 25 part story in which they level up, encounter events and just beat up a ton of monsters. Combat is done through a thrilling multi-use card system in which played combine two halves of two cards to perform their turn. Add in some hidden goals, deck optimization and a dash of openable boxes, and that's Jaws of the Lion.  

Would I recommend it:    
I do in general, but I'm personally not sold on Gloomhaven as a solo game. I truly love the game as a cooperative experience, mostly because there's nothing quite like it. There's absolute magic in a Gloomhaven turn going tits up that you don't really get in other games, and that facet of the game is fully missing once you introduce perfect information. The solo game is most commonly played by controlling two characters, and to me it really erases the magic that is Gloomhaven. However, if you like the combat system in Gloomhaven and enjoy just doing each turn in that game perfectly, you can't really go wrong. The story is mostly disposable, but the encounters and dungeons are really fun and the design going into each of those encounters is second to none.  

Also, I do want to say that I mind the mixing of miniatures and standees in Gloomhaven a lot less than the mixing of minis and meeples in Tiny Epic Dungeons. I am biased towards meeples over minis, but that aside; the separation of player miniatures and enemy standees helps you quickly parce the board and analyze the board in a way that you don't really get in TED. Maybe it's just a matter of scale, or maybe it's just my heart screaming for gorgeous unique meeples. All I know is that I liked the mix in Gloomhaven and actively disliked it in TED.  

Also also, full disclosure; I've gotten rid of my copy of Jaws of the Lion. I can see myself getting rid of some of the other games on this list in the future, but this is the only game that I have actually gotten rid of at this point in time.  

**Space Hulk fourth edition** - 4 plays (solo)  
What is it:  
""Not a solo game and not a dungeon crawler!"" I hear you yell at your screen. Let me get back to you on that. Before we deal with that though; Space Hulk is a game in which you play a group of genetic super soldiers (Space Marines) who are working through different scenarios in order to complete goals in an attempt to fend off a group of alien super killers (Genestealers). Each side of the conflict uses asymmetric rules and powers to try and crush the other side through some fast and quick dice chucking.  

Would I recommend it:  
So here's the deal. I will recommend Space Hulk to anyone who can get their hands on an affordable copy. Compare Space Hulk to the other games we've discussed here, and you'll see many similarities; grid movement, surviving waves of enemies, coordinating a small group of units. Along with that of course comes the fact that Space Hulk is a fantastic game, both two player and solo. The production value of this game is absolutely bonkers, with the thickest cardboard pieces I've ever seen and the fantastic miniatures that have long been Games Workshop's bread and butter. When it comes to the solo game I personally prefer playing both sides with me trying to win as the Space Marines, although you can find formerly official rules in the BGG files section. I really love how tense and difficult it is to win this game as the Marines, and how much fun it is to try and drink every part of their milkshake as the Tyranids.  

However, I can't in good conscience tell people to go search out a 300 dollar game just to play solo. There's no sense in that. So, either make damn sure that this is *your game* before selling a kidney for a fresh copy.  

**Let's talk about Mage Knight**:  
So for me, Mage Knight is the ultimate version of what I'm looking for in a roguelike dungeon crawler. Except of course for one thing; it's technically not a dungeon crawler. The world isn't a dungeon and you get to basically move around wherever you want. Besides that though, I really do think that there's no game like it when it comes to character progression, power escalation and that good power fantasy that I see most other games on this list try to approach in their own way. Really, give the game a chance. It's good.  

**Conclusion**:  
Bang for your buck, I feel that you're going to get a more rewarding experience out of most of the more expensive boxes, although there's a bunch of creative stuff happening in the cheaper boxes. When it comes to depth of gameplay and replayability though, Gloomhaven and Mage Knight take the cake. If you want the most game for the lowest price, I would personally recommend Mini Rogue over the other options (although Tiny Epic Dungeons is not far behind). This genre is probably the most fun I've had playing a solo game, and I can't wait to find out what else there is for me to explore.  

Also, feel free to leave suggestions and recommendations in the comments! If it's affordable I'll definitely try and check it out.",,28,,29,mage-knight,public

EDIT: I didn't realize I should have given some reviews or a tier list.  I'll make sure to add some thoughts to this post later tonight.  

Alright, here's my top 10 and bottom 5.  I got 3/4ths of the way through compiling a very in-dept response, but my computer crashed and I lost it all.  That in mind, I'll keep some of this pretty short - but I'm happy to expand on my thoughts. 


**TOP TEN:**

**Wingspan** – I like this because it is a slow to medium paced game where you have to make difficult and crucial decisions each round.  Your Engine will be different each time, and there are a ton of strategies to try out.  It also does not really feel like a competitive game even though it is, and I like that I can basically just focus on what I’m doing.  It’s almost like putting together a puzzle next to someone doing the same.  The expansions are not necessary, but I do recommend them.  The Europe one adds a lot of cards, and the Oceania expansion adds cards in addition to a new resource/mechanic.

**Radlands** – I can’t stress enough how much I love this game.  It is a competitive card game based on destroying your opponents three bases, while protecting your own.  Each game feels like an epic tug-of-war of attrition.  Every time I think I’m about to win, my opponent takes a turn and completely takes the wind out of my strategy.  It’s a game that forces you to be aware of everything on each board, and to adapt quickly when things go wrong.  I’m not sure if it is the production value that draws me in so much (I have the version with the playmats and chunky plastic tokens), or the constant emotional rollercoaster that makes me love it so much..  I have always like the concept of Magic, but there is just an overwhelming amount of content and mechanics to deal with so it never clicked.  I feel like Radlands has the same general feel of Magic, but in a much more streamlined package. 

**Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition** – I have only been able to play about 3 games of this, but holy cow do I love it.  I love strategically trying to figure out how to make the best engine to get the resources to terraform Mars.  This is another competitive game that doesn't feel competitive, I just kind of chill and do my thing.

**Dice Throne, AKA BATTLE DICE.** - This is just a really cool concept that was executed really well.  The production value is insane, the games feel balanced, and it has an easy entry point for people who don't play a lot of board games.  Plus, it is just pure dumb fun to roll dice.  This one hits the table a lot because it's one of the few that bot Myself and my Partner enjoy a lot.

**Dice Throne Adventures** - I mean, it mixes Dice Throne with one of my favorite genres - Roguelite Dungeon Crawler.  There is a ton of content to explore, including 4 big boss fights, so it feels like you really get your money's worth.  I really love that you get to upgrade your deck between sessions, and I like that it gives you the option to make Dice Throne cooperative.

**Pandemic Legacy/Pandemic Games** - Pandemic was the first board game I played as an adult, around 2012.  My partner at the time an I played probably 50+ sessions and were just obsessed with it, so it's a gimme to have in the collection.  I picked up Call of Cthulu as well, which is similar in concept, but executed differently.  It's pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's more amazing than Pandemic.  What is amazing is Pandemic Legacy Season 1.  It took me a while to pull the trigger because of the cost of entry, but I am glad I picked it up.  I love the stress that comes from knowing that your session is going to permanently alter your experience going forward.  It feels wrong to rip up a card, but that's part of the thrill.

**Codenames** - This is just a fun game to play socially with people who don't really board game.  The concept is simple and point of entry is low.  It also usually ends in a lot of laughter because ""WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE POSSIBLY MEANT?!""

**Tiny Epic Galaxies** - Everyone I have tried to play this with hates it, which sucks because I think it is brilliant.  I like having to make difficult decisions on what to do with your rolls, and collecting planets is fun.  Not much more to say than that

**Gloomhaven JOTL** - Absolutely love this game.  It is increadibly in depth, has a massive amount of content, and forces you to be highly strategic.  I have only been able to play two sessions with a friend, but I'm really hoping to get it on the table more.  I love RPG's, so this game holds a lot of value to me.

**Trash Pandas** - I will be honest, I have no idea why I love this game.  It is not on anyone's list, no one talks about it, it's a overly simple concept of rolling dice to gain actions.  It's just chill to play in-between more complex games.  I just like it.

**BOTTOM FIVE:**

**Side Effects** -  Honestly I did not expect anything great from this, so I can't really be mad.  The concept is fun and the art is pretty good, and it just seemed kind of novel.  I'll likely never get this one on the table, so it will probably just take up space until I need it for something else.

**Flux** - A game that develops as you go is fun in theory, but in practice it just feels like work trying to keep everything straight. And that's just how I feel about the base game, some of the others are just unnecessarily complicated.

**Cuphead** - Love the art, love the production value, love Cuphead.  Hate the damn game itself though.  It feels like there's not enough time to actually get your actions, and you have barely any health so it's tough to get through one of the decks.  I'm keeping it as a collector's item, but it's unlikely that it will make it to the table again.

**Ticket to Ride** - My partner loves this, so it will stay in my collection, but I just find it kind of boring.  It's an easy game to teach people, so it's great for sessions with people who don't play a lot... but it's just not that fun to me.  

**Forbidden Island** - Look, it's ""*fine*"".  I got it because it looked cool on tabletop, and I like cooperative games.  What I found, however, is that this is basically ""My First Cooperative Game"".  It just feels like Pandemic watered down, nothing to really write home about.  It's easy enough to teach people, so I'll probably keep it for now... at least until I want something that can take the space.


I did not put Arkham Horror LCG anywhere, but I want to acknowledge it.  Everyone loves this game, I kind of get why.  My problem is that it has entirely too much going on, and I have no idea how to play after doing 6+ hours of going through the rulebooks and watching videos.  There are just too many questions that come up which aren't easy to answer quickly.  I would probably love this game if I had someone experienced to sit through it with me and help me understand how certain situations should play out.  I could also just be dumb and lazy, completely possible.",,109,,55,,public
boardgames,"What games are only good at one player count, and not so good with any other number of players?",False,80,0,"For me, **Alhambra** is only good with 3 players. At 2 players, the race to get majority of each color isn’t as interesting. With 4 or more players, the market changes too much and you can’t plan ahead.

Also, I only enjoy **Parks** at 2 players. I love the action selection mechanism, but with 3 or more players the options feel too limited and can result in feeling like the game is playing itself.

boardgames,u/boardgamerecommeder needs a new home,False,73,0,"Hi all,

I'm the author of u/boardgamerecommender. It's the board game recommendation bot I've run here for, I don't know, 7 years? 8 years? It's given me personally so many great finds and I know it has for at least some of you. I wouldn't have found several of my now-favorite games without it, which was my original goal!

Sadly, I recently underwent a series of pretty serious medical conditions, and then I moved towns and personal situations, which as a result, has left me not running the bot for quite a while. Sorry about that. I'm going to get it re-connected within the next week. Thanks to the users who notified me about it and sorry I took a while to get onto it.

I've run stuff like /u/boardgamerecommender for a long time. [couchmoney](https://couchmoney.tv/), [coldwarsoundtrack](http://coldwarsoundtrack.com/), private forums for sufferers of oddly specific conditions, [couchmoneytrivia](https://couchmoneytrivia.tv), and contributions to open source, among others.

Unfortunately, I can't do that anymore and so would like a new home for u/boardgamerecommender. It has some very specific requirements:

1. able to run on a 24/7 server for the foreseeable future and commit to supporting this community better than I have
2. able to run Java with at least 16 GB of RAM dedicated to two processes with a significant amount of I/O, as well as a few hundred GB of storage
3. a person who has been a professional full-time Java developer for at least 5+ years and can demonstrate that to me
4. a person who has at least 5+ years profile history of being helpful and positive on Reddit, especially but not necessarily on r/boardgames or other gaming subs
5. a person who is happy to agree to a document to never personally financially benefit from recommending board games to people

If you think you match the above, which I think someone on this sub will, let's have a chat! If you think these requirements are too extreme, feel free to express yourself, but I'm confident I will find someone who matches the above and don't really want to debate my requirements.

It's possible that command-line bots like u/boardgamerecommender have run their course and people now only want mobile websites/apps instead; usage has significantly declined in the past couple years. Whether or not that's the case, I would still be willing to share everything this project has taught me with anyone who qualifies under #4 and #5 above.

boardgames,I want to gift a friend a board game but I can’t remember the name.,False,26,0,"UPDATE: solved by Blue Bombardier. Starship Interstellar  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pendragongamestudio/starship-interstellar



My friends birthday is coming up in November. He loves board games. He showed me a video of one he is interested in but I can’t remember the name nor find the video. 

I don’t want to spoil the gift so I can’t ask him out right. If I describe the game can someone help me locate it? 

The game was a space in a spiral looking layout. The sun or black hole (can’t remember which) is expanding and will eat and consume all the planets. Each player is a nation that is moving operations and ships to other planets or moons and what not. Each nation is contributing to a mega ship ark that will take off and leave the solar system. 

Each player wants to leave influence of their country on the ark ship. So researching and accomplishing tasks is how you do so. As time goes on the sun or black hole sucks the tile spaces towards the center and eats those spaces until you run out. 

He said he was interested in it but couldn’t afford it. I think it was plastic heavy.

boardgames,SHUX '22 Was Fantastic (you should go next time),False,215,0,"Wanted to give a shout out to the entire SUSD crew for running such an unexpectedly good convention.  Many people commented on how it was such a nice change from other cons (PAX, GenCon, etc.) in being a bit more down to earth and more of a chance to enjoy playing games rather than get swept up in ""con stuff"".

It is definitely one I will be attending in the years to come.  Thank you so much for making this experience possible.

A few observations from the event include:

**Games That Were Always Being Played**

* Inis (seriously, seriously popular)
* Captain Sonar
* Wonderland's War
* Undaunted (multiple versions)
* Ra
* Brass Birmingham
* Terra Mystica / Gaia Project

**Memorable Events**

* When the whole hall applauded the winner of the all-day 8 player TI4 game

* Making eye contact with the person holding a blue balloon (looking for more players) and giving them the nod 

* Quinns, Tom, and Pip employing an actual lawyer from the crowd to recover the madly conceived ""Quinn's Courtroom"" panel

* Getting to chat during the ""sign stuff"" panel

**Con Positives**

* Lots of room to play games, you never had to wait for a table spot to open up

* 4x (4!) simultaneous games of Blood on the Clocktower running nearly all con

* Great lending library; had nearly everything you would have wanted in it

* Super smooth badge process and friendly volunteers

* Meeting lots of great new people when looping in additional players; nearly a 100% pleasant experience rate which is far better than you might usually get in a public board game group gathering.

* Con dynamics meant you could play games nearly back to back for the entire day if you wanted, great value for time

**Con Negatives (Con-Cons?)**

* Not enough Matt. We missed you Matt.

* Odd concession hours.  Tough in a ""no outside food"" venue to have it open late and close early.

**Games of the Show**

* Ready Set Bet (AEG) -- lots of loud shouting and general enjoyment; app is genuinely useful to the game

* Blood on the Clocktower (Pandemonium Institute) -- tougher to run in a loud environment, but I was impressed with how cleanly people could be onboarded and ready to play using only the base materials; was really thoughtful to split out ""new"" and ""advanced"" groups",,56,,215,twilight-imperium,public

boardgames,My experience at the first World Series of Board Gaming in Las Vegas,False,150,0,"I'm finally back from World Series of Board Gaming and it was quite a week. Overall I had a really great time and the use of the Dice Tower West games library for attendees to check out games was absolutely amazing... so many games available to play that it made my head spin!   


But I also think it's important to recognize a few things that could have been done better:   


1. Where games had low signups, some frustrating decisions were made on how to handle the tournament rounds. For example, I was in the Dominant Species Marine tournament, and there were apparently only 22 people signed up for it. This number does not allow for a simple, even set of tables, and so the organizers had to come up with a strategy on how to run the three rounds of the tournament. Unfortunately, they decided to focus on having a four-player table in the final as the main goal, and it meant that they seated only two tables of four (of which I was a player in) for the first round, and gave FOURTEEN byes to the other players, who sat around for three hours while eight of us competed for two spots in round 2. It was incredibly frustrating to feel that I had to compete for a seat in the ""real"" tournament in round 2, and I didn't win that game so I was out, while 14 people ""jumped the line"". A similar issue apparently happened with Gaia Project as well, though I think they only ended up with something like 7 byes in round 1.  


2. Time was seemingly haphazardly dealt with. On Saturday, the Terraforming Mars tournament started at 9am, and I was signed up for Dune Imperium at 3pm the same day. Apparently, one of the ROUND ONE tables of Terraforming Mars still had not finished by 3pm, and for some reason that meant that we couldn't get seated for our first round of Dune Imperium until almost 3:30. That would have been fine.... except that when it got to be 5:00, we were told ""you have 30 minutes left!"" because the second round was scheduled for 5:30, and despite our complaints that we lost a half hour at the beginning of our slot, we were still forced to speed through a few rounds at the end, potentially upsetting the strategy of those at the table (including my own). So then, why were the Terraforming Mars players allowed to play for HOURS past their scheduled time, but then our much shorter time was cut even shorter?   


3. A smaller complaint, but the awards ceremony on Sunday evening was pretty poorly attended because people needed to get to flights and it was held at 5pm. Not sure how to make this better though.  


Again, overall I really had a fantastic time, and I would for sure be interested in competing again in the future. Perhaps after a few years to work out some kinks and growing pains, though.",,83,,150,dune-imperium,public

boardgames,"[Self-Promotion] I've been working for 5 years on a Pokemon-inspired game that's played with Poker cards, and the first prototype arrived!",False,28,0,"[Here it is!](https://imgur.com/a/kIwEcq2)

The game is called Enmity Engine. It's a horror-themed fighting card game for 2 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes (but can be as quick as 10-15 minutes if you're used to playing). It works like this: Each player has a team composed of 3 Fighters and a deck of Poker cards. Both players have one Active Fighter out at any given time that face off against each other.

Each round, both players take 1 action, then choose a move by setting a card from their hand face-down. Once both players are done, they reveal their face-down cards and, depending on what move cards they chose, resolve their moves, which will either cause them to Attack or Switch their Active Fighter.

Over the course of the game, your Fighters generate a resource called Insight, which can be spent to Awaken them to upgrade their abilities or launch their Signature Moves (kinda like Mega Evolutions and Z-Moves, to borrow Pokemon's terms).

The game ends when one player's Fighters are defeated, after which the other player wins the game.

After playing simultaneous reveal fighting card games like Yomi, BattleCON, and Exceed for a while, I noticed that they were the closest we had to a tabletop version of competitive Pokemon, and that inspired me to start working on this game. Over the years I spent working on it, it's changed form drastically multiple times as I tried to figure out how moveset customization would work, starting from being a Sakura Arms-style dueling game where you construct your card pool after looking at your opponent's options, to being a handbuilder, to being a Smash-Up style shuffle-builder, to being a deckbuilder, until finally I decided to just axe customization to get what we have now.

And I'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out. For one, it made playtesting/balancing much less of a nightmare, but it also makes it a breeze to setup and play. Half the setup is basically just choosing 3 Fighters and shuffling up your Poker deck, which makes it easy to just play like 10 games in a row, since there's so little downtime.

If you're interested in the game, please check out the website I set up for it, where you can find a sample print &amp; play and rules PDF.

boardgames,What I learned from 100 games of 7 Wonders (with Stats!),False,690,0,"TLDR:

Have you ever felt that a lot of strategic and tactical advice in board games is based on personal opinions that are not backed up by actual data? If the answer is yes, you are going to enjoy this read.

As a guy that loves stats, excel and board games, I dissect data from 100 games of 7Wonders (played over the course of the last 2 years) to back up arguments on some apparent contrarian opinions, which wonders seem to overperform and underperform, and the deeper implications on general strategy that this analysis suggests.

At the end of all this, 7Wonders remains a wonderful game that strikes a healthy mix between randomness and skill giving both first timers a fairly good shot at winning the game, and veteran players opportunities to stand out by carving out small edges at every turn.

But do not despair! There are still plenty of opportunities here to justify your loss at your gaming table because of some statistically underpowered wonder…

Link to all the data can be found here: [7Wonders Stats (100 games)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M0M3_MZKtMM6r0bk07wYEITEZOTK0vyDfiPb4wp_auE/edit?usp=sharing)

—--------------------------------------------------------

Back in 2019 I received 7 Wonders as a Christmas gift from my sister. She knew I was a big boardgame fan and that I have always been interested in ancient history, so she thought this game would be a perfect combination for me. As some here will probably relate, I am always a bit apprehensive when receiving boardgame presents from people that are not into the hobby, and I won’t lie, I was sceptical here too. Little did I know that a pandemic was about to come, and that this would become my most played game of the last two years..

As we started playing more often, I quickly acquired a few expansions, and once I integrated them into the core game, I started keeping track of our scores on an excel spreadsheet (see attached). Fast forward 2.5yrs, 31 friends and 100 games later, and this is the result.

All games recorded have been played with the same exact setup of core games + the following expansions:- 7 Wonders: Cities (includes Petra and Byzantium)- 7 Wonders: Cities Anniversary Pack (adds more Cities cards)- 7 Wonders: Wonder Pack (we used only The Great Wall and Stonehenge)

Why specifically only those? I like the base game the way it is, the only expansions I added were those that made it “more of the same”.

You can find a lot of guides online that share a lot of good strategies and ideas, but they all do it with only the core game in mind. As not everyone will be familiar of the characteristics with Cities, here is a heads up:

It stretches the core game by an extra turn – which means scores will be higher on average.- Cities cards work like Guild cards: there are a lot more of them in the pool than you play with in a single game, and you shuffle them inside the deck based on the number of players. This means that in a larger group, you will get to see a lot more Cities cards and have more opportunities to score points from them.- Cities cards do not have a single theme, but they have small thematic groups that align to all other card colors: better economy, coin losing cards, military boosts (both in points and shields), big point cards, extra Science cards.

The original idea behind collecting the stats was purely to answer one question: are all wonders built equally?

You can find plenty of analysis online of wonders that state “X is better than Y”, but they are all opinions for the most part, and they all analyze wonders in a vacuum based on their experience. What I can promise you here is that all of my arguments will be based on data. You might disagree with my findings, but we will all be discussing things from the same baseline.

**READERS BEWARE**: I’m well aware that 100 games are not really what a statistician would call a “statistically significant” number, nor does it follow rigorous statistical analysis. It is also going to be idiosyncratic to the way our group plays, and might not be representative of all tables. This is really just for the fun of seeing patterns in the data, speculate, and, most importantly, give you that much needed ammunition to complain at your table that you didn’t win because of some overpowered wonder…

Before we jump into the wonders analysis, I thought it might be interesting to look at some interesting insights from the data I collected. Here is my list.

# TOP 5 OBVIOUS FINDINGS:

1. **Yes, massive Science combos do win you games** – your win rate increases by a whopping 10.6% points above average when you score 25 or more Science points.
2. **But avoiding Science is fine too** – avoiding Science altogether does not have a significant impact on your win chances.
3. **And yes, Military blow outs also win you games** – similarly to Science, your win rate increases by 9.3% points when scoring 11 or more Military points.
4. **You are (sort of) right at choosing that B side** **(for the original wonders)**:
   1. A side (original 7 wonders): 20.8% winrate
   2. B side (original 7 wonders): 26.4% winrate
   3. That said, most A sides perform just fine and within average, with a couple of exceptions (Babylon and Rhodos)
5. **You can be (statistically) significantly better at this game than your friends** – as my friend proves, by not only winning well above expected, but also scoring on average much higher than any other player. Funny enough, when I asked them how they do it, they simply stated that they always focus on maximizing their own score, not preventing others from accessing good cards. It is not quite what you read on online articles, but it seems to be really effective at our table.

# TOP 5 SUPRISING FINDINGS:

1. **4 player games have the lowest points averages** – this might be due to the abundance of resource cards at 4 players (as highlighted by Red Proper[ here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/691370/some-complex-strategies-7-wonders)), or other card distributions. Just don’t be surprised when you play with 4 players and you have a low score and get away with a win.
2. **Economic cards are bad for you** – no matter which way you cut it, Economic points have a fairly apparent negative correlation to win rate (basically scoring any Economic points always lowers your win chances). On top of that, many wonders performance seem inversely correlated to how many Economic points/game they average. This is probably due to a combination of factors, including the fact that economic cards score poorly in the Third Age in particular. Also, anecdotally, our best player almost always stays away from them.
3. **Byzantium doesn’t suck** – in fact it holds a very respectable win rate with both side A and B. And, even though it is so far a small sample, it doesn’t seem to perform much worse at higher player counts (where you would intuitively assume its power becomes less effective).
4. **Stonehenge doesn’t suck either** – regardless of its apparent nonsensical Wonder stages point structure, Stonehenge does not seem to suffer particularly bad average points nor win rates. Solutions to fix this wonder seem unwarranted.
5. **Players really build affinity for certain wonders** – our best player won EVERY single time they played The Great Wall B, and 8 out of 9 times with The Great Wall overall. I got 50% winrate with both Giza and Halikarnassus, much higher than any other player. There are cases with other players as well.

Okay, back to the wonders. So, how do you determine if a wonder is good or not? After much deliberating, I settled for 2 key metrics:

|**Win Rate Performance**                                     (Win Rate above/below Expected Win Rate)|This metric subtracts the blend of your expected win rate (33% in a 3-player game, 25% in a 4-player game etc.) from your actual win rate. Positive means you win more often than you should, negative you win less often than you should.                                                             We will refer to this stat as “Win Rate Performance” for simplicity from now on.|
|:-|:-|
|**Points Performance**                                       (Average Points of the Player/Wonder above/below Average Points in a Game)|For each game I calculated the average (ex. hypothetical 3-player game of 60, 50 and 40  points would mean an average of 50) and calculated the delta from average in the game (so for the same game: +10, 0, -10). A positive average delta means that you consistently score above average, while a negative one means you consistently score below. This stat should be able to catch Wonders that perform well overall, but might have missed out on a few wins by small margins.                                                       We will refer to this stat as “**Points Performance**” for simplicity from now on.|

# THE OVERPOWERED WONDERS:

**The Great Wall B**

|Win Rate Performance|\+22.6%|Win Rate|Expected Win Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Points Performance|\+2.95 pts|45.5%|22.8%|

\# Games: 22

||Avg  Pts|Military|Coins/ Debt|Wonder|Civilian|Economic|Science|Guilds|Cities|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Average|**64.0**|3.1|4.1|0.0|10.8|1.9|35.9|5.8|2.4|
|When Win|**70.4**|1.5|3.9|0.0|7.8|0.8|46.4|7.0|3.0|
|When Loss|**58.7**|4.4|4.3|0.0|13.3|2.8|27.2|4.8|1.9|

Are you looking for a wonder to exclude from your games? Look no further than The Great Wall, with an almost 50-50 chance of winning the game when playing with the B side (although not on the same level, A side performs rather well too).

The Great Wall B side is the true standout performer among all wonders, topping every metric: highest win rate, highest average points per game, highest Win Rate Performance, highest Points Performance.

What makes The Great Wall B side so strong?

**Science, Science and more Science:** The obvious piece is that GW scores a whopping 35.9 points/game on science, the most of any wonder. The only other one that comes even close being the A side of GW. There are a trio of synergistic elements that make this happen:

\- Cloth starting resource on the board makes it easy to grab science early on.

\- Two wonder powers are linked to paper, another manufactured good. This further encourages grabbing paper early on, which makes you primed for an early science start.

\- In case you don’t get access to manufactured goods in the early rounds, stage 4 is the perfect counter – giving you any type of resource you don’t have to capture those precious science cards.

**Missing out on Military**: GW B is one of the lowest scorers on the board for military, but even more interesting is the fact that winners with GW B only score 1.5 points in Military (losers with GW B score 4.4 points on average in Military). It seems that players that lean on the wonder’s peace power are rewarded, but it also exemplifies another emergent theme: when you go heavy on science, you sacrifice the right opportunities to play military cards.

**Accumulate those coins:** Another, very surprising, point of note is that GW B has the highest points from coins than any other wonder (the only one averaging above 4 points/game), DESPITE scoring very low with economic cards. This is even more apparent when looking specifically only at GW B winners, who only score 0.8 points from economic cards on average. The Stage 1 power giving you 8 coins must have something to do with it, but GW A has a similar wonder stage and only manages 1.3 points/game from coins. This leads us back to the point about manufactured goods – you need few resources to get your engine going and can compensate for the missing ones with your Stage 4. This helps heavily reduce the number of coins you have to pay to your neighbours - which in turn potentially stifles their own chances of purchasing much-needed resources.

**Avoid Economic cards:** The low point score from Economic cards goes contrary to something I surely thought was the case: that 4 stage wonders (Giza and The Great Wall) are heavily favoured because of the Arena. GW B players, and winners in particular, very rarely benefit from building an arena as a way to capitalize on all 4 stages.

Looking at the average stats of all losers with GW B, we can also learn **how to defeat it**: block them out of Science cards, pushing them to lean into Military and Civilian structures.

One interesting point to note that is GW B is statistically significantly better than its A side cousin, contrary to much online tribal wisdom. This is exactly what I was hoping to achieve with this analysis, actually debating wonders using data instead of simply strategic opinions. I think this comes down to ease of build for wonder stages. Side A stages lack resource synergies and are quite expensive, while on side B you have 2 very clear routes to go: paper+wood, or stone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Halikarnassus B**

Halikarnassus B comes third both in Winrate Performance and Points Performance, suggesting it is a very consistent performer.

**Science (again)**: Hal B shares many characteristics with The Great Wall B: a very high Science scorer, while being a low Civilian, Economic and Military scorer. Hal B scores high on Science thanks to the following:

\- It starts with a manufactured good, giving it an early boost to Science.

\- Its power allows it to recover some science cards that might be discarded away, recovering on missed out opportunities, or potentially recovering a missing resources and manufactured goods necessary to build missing Science card trees.

**Forget about Civilian points:** Hal B is the lowest scorer of Civilian  points out of all wonders. This is something it has in common with GW B as well. But data suggests that Civilian cards strategies are not underpowered. I wonder if this is more of a lagging indicator: it might have to do with the fact that Civilian cards are always good points options when nothing else is available, and they very rarely end up in the discard pile, reducing chances for Hal B players to score points from them.

**Opportunistic Military:** However, interestingly enough, winners with Hal B score 3 points less on average in Military while scoring 3 points more on average with Civilian cards compared to those that lose with the wonder. It might mean that winners commit less cards to Military, managing to score just enough points from a discarded card, giving them more opportunities to secure points from elsewhere.

**Snatch those Guild cards:** Hal B winners score &gt;10 points/game with Guild cards and Hal B side scores 2 more points from Guild Cards than its side A cousin on average. Jury is still out as to whether we can make any statistically significant guesses from Guild cards without looking at the specifics of each game, but my educated guess would be that Hal B power makes it easy to grab extra resources, which means Hal B is rarely locked out of Guild cards and can capitalize on those opportunities.

|When Loss|**58.9**|3.1|3.1|15.9|13.8|3.5|8.0|9.1|3.2|

Petra A’s winrate might make it an odd choice for most powerful wonder, but it has a surprisingly outstanding Points Performance: the only wonder other than The Great Wall B to average &gt;+2 points.

Do you remember all you learned about Halikarnassus and The Great Wall? Forget military, forget Civilian and go heavy Science? Well Petra A goes against ALL of that. This is what makes this game so interesting!

**High Wonder Stage Points**: Petra A’s biggest strength is (of course) its Wonder stages points. Not only Petra A scores the 2nd highest Wonder  points per game (16.2), but what makes it truly standout (and differentiate from its B side), is by how easily it can maximize its Wonder  points. Petra A players scored all 17 of their Wonder points in 17 out of 18 occasions. The Wonder  points give you a strong points base to build from with only 3 cards. No Petra A player ever scored less than 53 points in a game, the highest floor of any wonder.

**Flexible**: Looking at the overall average, it can be difficult to discern much else about Petra A. being middle of the road in most categories. However, this also suggests that it is a very flexible wonder that can be played many different ways.

**Red and Blue:** We can see some trends here. Winners with Petra A score a whopping 10.4 Military points/game on average. Petra A is perfect for this strategy: 2 of its Wonder stages requiring Stone and Wood, while providing you Clay as a starting resource. The perfect invitation to lean a Civilian + Military strategy, topped up with some nice 17 Wonder points.

**Combo with Cities Cards:** This strategy can be often complemented by some good Cities cards. Although random in nature, you are likely to find some that either boost Military (extra shields, extra points per Military Victory or even extra Military Victories altogether) or plain points (there are 2 separate heavy points structure trees). Petra A winners capitalize on this, scoring on average 4 more points from Cities cards than their losing counterparts. The cherry on top of the Wonder+Blue+Red strategy is Black.

# THE UNDERPOWERED WONDERS:

**Rhodos A**

|When Loss|**56.9**|10.3|2.3|9.1|12.7|3.3|4.0|8.1|7.2|

It is now time for the less fun part, the losing side of the coin. There were certainly some surprises, like Rhodos A, which boasts the worst winrate of any wonder, and is a strong runner for worst wonder overall.

I had to think really hard on this one, because there are many conflicting statistics. Does the fact that Rhodos A scores poorly (and Rhodos B not faring much better), while The Great Wall/Halikarnassos scoring highly without Military, mean that Military strategies suck? Statistics seem to indicate otherwise – across all wonders the average winner scores &gt;3 points/game more from Military than the average loser.

Maybe it has to do with the fact that Rhodos requires 4 ore resources to build a wonder stage, which is hard to get and easy to block? I thought this was a good lead, but I found out that the average player gets full wonder stage points 88% of the time, which is well within average across the board, and better than many wonders.

So, what’s wrong with Rhodos A?

**Feeling Blue**: it is a well-documented strategy that Military and Civilian go well together because they require much of the same resources. Yet, Rhodos A seems to struggle to capitalize on this synergy, scoring a very average 13.2 points/game from Civilian cards (Rhodos B on the other hand does the job really well with 19.2 points/game from Civilian, leading to much better win rates and average points/game).

**Wonder stages resource requirements**: yes I know I just said that 4 ores wasn’t a leading cause of weakness, but I think it is worth looking deeper at Rhodos A from a resource/reward perspective. As wiser people online have pointed out, the 2 shields bonus that Rhodos A gives you is only good if you also build Military cards to capitalize on it. But Rhodos’ stages have fairly high resource requirements: you need to get 2 woods, 3 clay and 4(3) ores. Clay is not a particularly useful resource for Civilian cards in the high amounts the wonder needs, and only 2 Military cards require more than 1 ore, and one of them needs stone. Furthermore, you will be excluded from some Military buildings without a hefty amount of stone, and you need at least access to all manufactured goods to capitalize on a palace, guilds and other powerful cards in the Third Age. That is a lot of resources you need access to for a Blue/Red strategy. It is true that wonders like Giza also require hefty resources, but they reward you with immediate points (can 2 shields give you &gt;5 points/game consistently?).

&amp;#x200B;

**Babylon A**

|When Loss|**58.3**|0.9|1.3|8.4|15.5|2.5|18.9|5.5|5.3|

You might be tempted to think that all the worst wonders would have in common a low scientific score, but Babylon A is here to prove otherwise. Babylon A is another case of a Wonder side that typically online is considered stronger than its B side counterpart, but that stats prove otherwise.

**Coins and Resources struggles**: one of the most atypical aspects of this wonder is that it is designed with Science in mind, but starts without a manufactured good. Starting with Clay means that you need more turns to get your Science engine firing and, unless extremely lucky, you end up paying at least once for a manufactured good from a neighbour to get a precious Science card in the First Age. This often creates a vicious cycle of starting the Second Age low in coins, forcing you into Economic cards to boost your income first, and potentially missing out on some of the best cards in the first hand of the Second Age without the necessary coins to access your neighbours’ resources. This is why Babylon A’s average Science score/game (22.2) is high, but much lower than Science powerhouses The Great Wall B (35.9) and Halikarnassos B (27.3), and why it is not enough to compensate for missing out on points in other areas. This is further validated by Babylon A’s lowest score from Coins in the game (1.3 points/game on average) – it seems that to go for the Science strategy you need to spend a lot of coins.

**Science over Military**: do you remember our discussion for Halikarnassos? Same applies here – trying to go heavy Science sacrifices Military structures. Babylon is the 2nd lowest scorer for average Military points/game (0.5), after Byzantium A, which is a wonder that pushes you into avoiding conflict altogether!

**Those damn Guilds**: Babylon A has another really low score area, which it shares with Petra B – very low average Guild card scores. A high guild score does not necessarily make you a winner, but it seems that those resource and economic struggles at the beginning limit your ability to get your hands on key guild cards in the Third Age.

|When Loss|**54.4**|4.4|2.5|15.1|17.3|4.6|1.9|3.7|4.9|

Petra B is the a really tough wonder to play with. No other wonder has a bigger difference between their A side and their B side than Petra. But why does Petra B suck so much when Petra A doesn’t?

**14 Coins!**: Accumulating 14 coins to score 14 points is a much more daunting task than 7 coins for 7 points of it’s A side. While accumulating 7 coins might be something a resource heavy strategy would naturally lean into (by virtue of your neighbours buying resources from you), getting to 14 coins requires you to plan for it. A plan that needs to counteract Cities cards, many of which cause players to lose coins, further hurting Petra B.

**Economic cards**: so what does the Petra player do to catch up on coins? Play a lot of economic cards, the only one with a fairly negative correlation to win rate. By playing economic cards, especially in the second and third age as they are trying to catch up on the coins they need to build their last wonder stage, Petra B loses on many opportunities to make big strategic commitments (like Science). This is why Petra B players have the lowest average Science score overall (1.7 points/game), and the highest average Economic score (5.2 points/game).

**Guild cards**: The third piece I had not quite noticed before is that Petra B players also significantly miss out on Guild  points. Petra B has the lowest  points/game from Guild cards (3.6), with only 40% of Petra B players scoring any Guild points, compared to \~70% of players in the average game across all wonders. And while Guild cards are not necessary to win, Petra B often arrives in the Third Age with too many things yet to do (accumulate coins, build wonder, not missing out on high points Civilian cards), hurting its chances at snatching good Guild cards.

# FINAL THOUGHTS:

After spending hours looking at the game statistics, it’s disappointing to know that, even with all this knowledge and time spent analyzing this game, I am not even the best player at my table.

All that effort was not in vain however, as I was able dissect the different wonders with as little bias as possible. Often online guides rely on a simple explanation of the wonder stages in a vacuum, which appear reasonable but often do not hold up to statistical scrutiny: Stonehenge might appear nonsensical, yet it scores perfectly fine and has a good win rate. The Great Wall A might appear a better side, yet the B side is so much better statistically. And the A side of the original 7 wonders is somewhat weaker only in the Babylon and Rhodos cases, while the others hold up just fine with their B side counterparts.

As I spent more and more time looking at the data, I was surprised that I started paying more attention to the resource costs of wonder stages instead of their powers. Certain wonders just seem primed to synergize well with resources, while others don’t. Nothing shows this contrast more than The Great Wall and Petra, both with similar powers on each side, yet with a blatantly more useful side than the other. You might see me again in the future dropping another article on some additional 7 wonders theorycrafting - especially if I can convince my friends to play another hundred or more games!

Like many eternally good board and card games, 7 Wonders has a fine balance of randomness and depth, where a player on their first couple of games is able to take home a win with a bit of luck, but also where a good player can consistently outperform their opponents. Finding that balance is hard, but when you do, you have a game that can be fun for friends and relatives that only play once a year, as well as entertain those, like me,  that want to dive really deep into the game.

I have shared the link to my data in the hope that actual statisticians will be able to play with it and reveal other interesting trends. All I ask of in return is to post the interesting findings you will find. I have left tables from my analysis in the sheet, some more useful than others, for those that are interested and want to deep dive into the data.

There are always new shiny games ready to steal away your time and attention, and it is unlikely that I will again have the chance to dedicate so much time to a single board game. However, 7 Wonders will remain an eternally enjoyable game that will continue to hit my table every time we have too many players for anything else, or when someone is secretly looking to improve their statistics…",,120,,690,,public

boardgames,Review of King’s Dilemma,False,3,0,"Let me preface this review by saying we just finished our 16th and final round of KD and I was the overall winner of the legacy game.

Going into this game, my expectations were that I was sitting on the small council like in Game of Thrones and I would have a lot of meaningful choices to affect the game. This unfortunately was nowhere near the result. As with any legacy game, I don’t like to look into the game TOO much incase I catch a spoiler so I probably could have watched some spoiler free videos to prepare myself first.

The good: I like having my own faction which I keep throughout the whole legacy. I think this is key to a good legacy. I also very much enjoyed the ending (which I won’t mention obviously). The artwork on the cards was also cool. The map that comes with the game is also cool.

The bad: the physical board is dull and a bit of a turnoff. You spend ~$100 on a game that has no miniatures and finite uses, I expect there to be a big map with pieces or a really cool board. This board looks like it was straight out of a prototype. While this may be a “good” for some people… but for me, this next point is a bad. The player who was doing the absolute worst in the game ended up with 2nd place based on how our game went in the endgame. There didn’t seem to be much of a payoff for me who entered the endgame as the clear leader compared to the player who entered having only won a single game. Seems a bit off to me.

The ugly: the rule book is BAD. I would say my group is pretty intermediate to heavy gamers and the rule book is horrific. They may as well not include it and make you guess the rules in some areas of the game. 

Overall: this game as a legacy game is about a 5/10 for me. In comparison, I would say Pandemic season 1 is a 10, Risk Legacy is a 1, and Scythe Legacy is about a 7-8.

There are no new fear, minor or major power cards in the game. The spirit panels are made from the same material that the cards are- which in my opinion is better because they can store in my base box with no issues. Also the spirit tokens are teal, dark red, and yellow so we now have more colors to choose from. Overall I am super stoked about having this set in addition to the other content. This will make playing this game with newer players much easier!",,7,,33,,public
boardgames,"I love card games but hate the monetisation of tcg, ccgs etc. Any games for me??",False,196,0,"I've played a lot of card games in the past (tcgs,ccgs,lcgs) but always end up getting burned out by the need to constantly spend money for a good deck or the constant power creep that makes my decks weaker after a year or so. 

Is there any game that feels like a card game but is actually a board game without constant investment (don't mind buying expansions every so often)?

I've played magic the gathering (mostly commander), Pokémon, game of thrones lcg, star wars lcg, star wars destiny.

boardgames,Tried -Mr. Jack- yesterday and we where quite dissapointed. Does anyone like it?,False,7,0,"About two weeks ago I bought the boardgame Mr Jack, because i liked the premise, the backstory and the artwork. Also the fact that it is made for two people made me hope it would make for a nice mysterious game for me and my gf.  Fast forward to yesterday where my gf and me finally got to unpack it and try it out. The rules where already a bit confusing , but once we read trough we just tried it out however we both didnt really know what to do to get the game started, no tactic we tried seemed to work or make any difference which made the game quite unenjoyable. 

We will try it again as it should be easier with a better understeanding of the rules. but i was left with a very dissapointed feeling in the end. Does anyone have the same feeling with this game. Maybe we missed something or was this just a waste of €25?",,15,,7,,public
boardgames,opinions on the game Bonfire (2020 Stefan Feld game),False,11,0,i was offered this game on my birthday and was surprised that I had never heard of it because I consume massive amounts of boardgame related media.

boardgames,Optional rules that shouldn't be optional?,False,34,0,"I recently picked up Paperback to play with my family. The first time we played, we elected not to use the optional rules in order to try and make the game simpler since it was everyone's first time (except for me, since I played it once before to learn it.) 

A lot of us ended up having turns where, after scoring our word, we wouldn't have enough points to purchase any of the letters from the offer. Now, there is an optional rule that lets place discount cubes on available letters which make them progressively cheaper as they remain available. We played it again tonight using that rule, and it totally got rid of the problem we had before and made the game much more fun.

Do y'all have any examples of rules that are considered optional that you think greatly improve the experience? Any that you think should just be part of the standard rules for the game?",,78,,34,,public
boardgames,Rule Questions about Everdell,False,5,0,"Ok, so I love this game but honestly the rulebook is not the best, because it leaves some questions unanswered or gives vague instructions. Maybe it was improved in later editions, idk. My question is actually a pretty basic one. It concerns how many cards you can have in your city. The way it was explained to me and the way I've played it ever since is that if you move a critter into a construction they share a space. So if you let the teacher move into the school they take up one space and you have a maximum of 15 spaces. (If you played the teacher first and then play the school, he can still move in but you have to pay for both, as far as I understand the rules). But whateverr order you play them in, they share a space. A few days ago, we played the game and had to look up something about a specific situation that can occur (and is not covered in the rulebook) about the crane and the architect which put the way we play it into question, so my 2 questions are:

1. Do a construction and the matching critter, if the critter was moved into the construction, share a space in your city or do they take up 2 spaces?
2. If you remove a construction, do you also remove the critter ""living"" in it? (I don't think so, but at this point I'm just confused)

The questions might sound stupid but I just always played it the way it was explained to me and never had a reason to question that. 

Oh and I know that if you move a critter out, you still leave the occupied token and cannot move another critter in.

Edit: Thanks for all the help. I really appreciate it and can go on enjoying Everdell even more!",,11,,5,,public
boardgames,I just played Terraforming Mars for the first time. Some of the most fun I've had in my life!,False,157,0,"TM is now the second modern board game I've played (Gloomhaven: JOTL) being first. And holy shit, this game is incredible. I was hesitant on the theme because it just didn't interest me much but I'm so glad I tried it. I had two coworkers over last night for board game night and had planned to play some Gloomhaven: JOTL with them. That same day I had received my copy of Terraforming Mars and both asked if we could try that instead since it looked cool. I was absolutely down, but told them we'd have to learn it together since I've never played it. We went through on some tutorials on YouTube and for the next SIX HOURS we learned and played and it was a shit show but seriously some of the most fun I've ever had in my life. The ending was even crazier because of how close we all were (I had 57 points, the other two had 58 and 61). I only have a few friends open to trying board games and the fact that they were both eager to try it made me so happy. I'm looking forward to playing more sessions in the future and we're thinking we'll try out Scythe next! If you guys have any cool recommendations, that would be cool too.

boardgames,What should I do with this concept,False,0,0,"Not sure if this is the right place for this but many years ago there were two bored Highschoolers in a rural New England town with nothing to do. We were both big into fantasy of all stripes and had lots of friends into it too so we decided to start a LARP. Unfortunately there were not enough nerds to sustain it and making equipment was expensive so it failed but I put a ton of narritive work into it and have wanted to do something with it ever since.

Basically the plot was High Fantasy filled with all the Tolkien stolen races we could so plenty of Orcs, Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, and Halflings as well as an OC race of blue skinned barbarians called Outlanders from the snowy wastes to the north. The lore was effectively all the races except the Outlanders lived in tribal/city state style communities in the southern lands until a hero frustrated by the incessant warring united the lands excluding the Outlanders under a single Imperial Banner. He brought peace and prosperity by delegating the tasks of the nation to six guilds. Warriors Guild to protect the Kingdom and be the Military, Wizards Guild who were the scholars of the Empire, Black Guild who were spies and assassins of the Empire, Rangers Guild who were bounty hunters capturing or killing criminals and monsters alike, Clerics Guild a religious order that honored beings known as Celestials and who valued order, fairness, and peace that were in charge of things like the courts and treasury while running their temples, and finally the Druids another religious order that honored nature and its chaotic and wild attributes, they worshipped Valkrie and helped prevent famine, plague, and natural disaster.

Eventually though all good things come to an end and the king died just after finding out his only heir had been killed in a battle with Outlanders. This plunged the Empire into chaos as lords fought over the throne leaving openings for Outlanders to invade, powerful warlords and wizards to take power, monsters to run rampant including a brief demon invasion and even walking plagues like Vampirism, Lycanthropy, and Zombism to run rampant. During this time the Guilds realized the Empire would likely disolve before a new Emperor emerged to lead them if they didn't act so they reformed and became pretty autonomous and began a major push in their perspective roles and with the aid of a number of powerful leaders were able to contain the major threats. 

This created a balance of power where there were effectively six autonomous kingdoms with the Guilds having varrying levels of influence in each. Basically everyone agrees the empire should be restored but all of the six kings want to sit on the throne. Furthermore the Guilds have gotten a taste of autonomy and now want to shape the new Empire into their own image making whoever sits on the throne less an all powerful Emperor and more a puppet to their Guild. Roughly the Warriors want a military state, Wizards want a magical Geniocracy where the smartest and most magically capable lead, the Black Guild rebranded as the Assassins or Thieves Guild want a mafia style state, Rangers more or less want a police state, and both the Clerics and Druids want a Theocracy with their religion installed.

In our original concept we designed it this way to create lots of room for conflict and betrayal that all groups would have concern in as nearly all players would have a kingdom and a guild and thus competing loyalties would mean when one kingdom fought another Guilds would have to worry about their own members from each kingdom fighting one another and the vice versa of when Guilds Feuded each Kingdom would have to worry about violence breaking out on their streets as (for example) their Wizard subjects and Ranger Subjects started killing one another. Even better when a Guild and Kingdom had a conflict they'd both have to fear who among their shared players would take what side.

The constant threat of rogue wizards and war lords, vampire nests and werewolf dens popping up, demobs trying to break back in and Outlanders at the gates would keep the pressure on preventing any faction from being idle too long and providing players a constant supply of quests to keep busy with. I thought this would be a cool system that would create dramatic moments as well as ensure new low level players were protected as griefing a low level player would ensure the wrath of both the players kingdom and guild. I've considered turning it into a board game or RPG but don't know if it could fit well into either of those mediums without really cutting some large parts away from what it is. What do you guys think?",,7,,0,,public
boardgames,October is here! Halloween is nearly upon us! Tell us about your favorite games with a spooky theme!,False,28,0,"Halloween season is my favorite time of year, and it's finally HERE!  I ordered myself a  copy of **Don't Go In There** to mark the occasion, but I've got a pile of other things to play that I haven't gotten to post-COVID.  But I have a few favorites from this year!

**The Hunger** by Richard Garfield has been a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to the upcoming expansion!

**Disney's Return of the Headless Horseman** is very much a game made for kids, but I like it.  It's cheap, the production is up to Prospero Hall's usual standards and covered in fun thematic details, and the 2 minis in the game are nice and big and full of character.

##FAQ

**I live in Barbados/Canada/Guatemala/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now I cnat spel amymor!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on hope and dreams, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

boardgames,So I guess I own a badly worn copy of a shitty edition of my least favorite board game now,False,860,0,"So I'm at a church tag sale, always the best tag sales because no one has any idea what anything is worth so they underprice everything.

They have the usual assortment of horrible mass market kids games, but I decided to look at an old copy of *Castle Risk,* because while I fucking hate *Risk* and the box of this particular copy was pretty damaged, some editions come with little castles and tanks and knights on horseback as pieces and you can keep the pieces for other, better games. *Axis and Allies* and *Monopoly City* are amazing for their repurposable minis and tokens.

And I open it up carefully, because even if it sucks it's still a board game so board game careful mode automatically flips on in my brain, and I notice that nope these pieces are fucking trash, the troop markers are random little plastic X's that literally look like sprue waste left over from making something better out of plastic. Even the castles, which one would imagine are the raison d'etre for a game called ""Castle Risk,"" are tiny and ugly.

Well, as I'm closing the box in disgust, this incredibly sweet little old lady comes over delighted that I'm looking at the game,  and explains how it was her grandson's favorite game as a boy, and she'd be so glad if it found a new home with someone who would treasure it, and no one else had noticed it even though the tag sale was nearly over now, etc. etc.

So now I own a badly worn copy of a shitty edition of my least favorite board game. At least it was only 50 cents. Don't buy *Castle Risk*.

boardgames,Thoughts in splitwave shipping?,False,1,0,"Hey community, with ISS Vanguard delivering the core box for those that opted for the more expensive splitwave shipping and not having an ETA on the stretch goals. It got me thinking about the concept of the shipping games in waves. 

I'll use ISS Vanguard (IV) as my example. 

So, the campaign ran in the beginning of 2021 if I recall correctly with the promise of shipping the game in the fall of the same year. Due to delays the core box shipped now. 

What do you think about this practice? If an estimated time of arrival excludes stretch goals can it truly be regarded to meet its promise? A campaign game like IV has lots of content with stretch goals increasing the playtime even more, are we happier getting parts of the game early, being able to finish it before more content arrives extending its shelflife? 

Do we even care? I'm curious of what the community thinks about this side of crowdfunding. 

For context, I'm a backer and did not opt for splitwave and I'm fine waiting until the 2nd wave. I prefer getting all of it at once for a lower price on shipping.",,16,,1,terraforming-mars,public
boardgames,What are your favorite action selection mechanisms?,False,13,0,"The hallmark of a lot of good euros is their action selection mechanism. 

Some of my favorites are: 

- Traditional Worker Placement - ex: Viticulture (restricted by the places you can visit and players competing for places)
- Worker Placement + Deck Building - ex: Dune Imperium &amp; Lost Ruins of Arnak (adds in a restriction of card locations)
- Bag Building - ex: Orleans (like worker placement, but you are drawing characters out of a bag you are building each with restrictions on where they can be placed)
- Player Board Selection - ex: Scythe (selecting one pair of actions from your board) 
- Action Selection Restricted by Dice Rolling - ex: Khora (select actions based on cards, but you are restricted by what you roll on dice)

A lot of gameplay and puzzle is built on top of the core action selection. But the central puzzle is how you manage your actions economically through their restrictions.

boardgames,Aesthetic Storage Solutions assistance,False,7,0,"I have several games (as do we all) that have been expanded upon. Storage is becoming an issue. I want to keep each game entirely in one box, but that has become challenging. Additionally, storing games in generic boxes is very unappealing to me, something I learned when I started pulling apart my small card games and putting them in clear storage bins. The games in question are:

* Dixit (currently in three thin/tall boxes)
* Firefly the game (current in a clear bin)
* Apples to Apples (currently in a clear bin)
* Elder Sign (overstuffed into original box, with two expansions in their own boxes)
* Terraforming Mars (overstuffed into the original box)

I know Terraforming Mars has the Big Box Kickstarter expansion, something I missed out on, so that's on my list and a planned purchase. I've looked into Broken Token boxes, particularly for Firefly, which I like, but they still lack in regards to me wanting to artfully display the games on my shelves.

What solutions have you all come up with? Any good products being made out there that I just haven't noticed? Thanks a bunch!",,6,,7,,public

boardgames,Betrayal at the House on the Hill Questions!,False,1,0,"So I recently picked up this game and I have a question. The people I play with just build out the mansion until they find an omen room and walk in and out of the room on their rolls to just stack omen cards to try and proc the haunt asap.

The two times we played the first haunt was the bats, that was over in like 1-2 turns, I lost almost immediately as the traitor. Then the second one was the mummy, another player won that one but it was such a downhill battle for the heroes. The mansion was so tiny the mummy almost won on the first turn of the haunt.

Is this really how the game is meant to be played? I find that we never have time to buff our character stats or build out the mansion or ever find items.

My second question, when we are playing the game and the haunt begins, if the survivor manual says ""Search the deck and add the kitchen to the mansion"" and it doesn't say that in the traitors manual, when we regroup and start playing the game do the survivors have to tell the traitor what happened during their prep phase? I found that when I played traitor as the bats I was forced to give up a lot of information of how they can interact with me and things I can do, but they didn't mention that the kitchen was added or whatever the correct tile was.",,17,,1,,public

Last piece of trim went up yesterday, and I thought if I were ever going to share this type of post, this would be the only time. I tried to make the post worthwhile and gave various info. I made a lot of custom stuff in the collection, including storage solutions, a gaming table, terrain, Crokinole board(s), and various other things.[link to game room album](https://imgur.com/a/GpsCxHs)

[edit] the table had my custom blood bowl pitch set up on it for the photo 

# The Project

We live in Wisconsin and went remote full time at the start of the pandemic. At that time none of my basement was finished, and working in a dungeon-like space during the winter months was pretty depressing. To top it off we locked down pretty hard, so I needed something to get me through the January-April months of being locked up inside. So I began finishing the 1200 or so square feet of my house. I did all the wiring, lighting, sheetrock, taping, mudding, painting, floors and finish work: all of it. I wanted a bright, warm feel to the basement where I now spend most of my time. The rest of the space not shown has a pool table and open area for playing room scale VR. Then my office space, workout area and art studio corner. It's all an open room with the posts down the middle.

# Custom made stuff

I posted a few things in the past so here's the info and links.

[Gaming table (not shown)](http://imgur.com/gallery/qsgw0) It's in our dining room and staying there

On the table is my [custom made Blood Bowl pitch](https://imgur.com/a/KSFP5) for the wood elf team ""The Mean Prey Trackers"".

I also make crokinole boards. [Link to a previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/geom55/covid_crokinole_boards_a_diy_report/) And I made a matching carrom board as well.

I designed the banners on the wall. The first has the logo for the league I run, and the other for my team. Printed on vinyl.

# Game Collection info

I used to run a weekly game night and had been doing that for about seven years, but COVID killed it. Consequently my game collection has gone through a bit of turnover. I eliminated some games that just weren't going to get played anymore and picked up more family/casual and ""evergreen"" or ""classic hobby"" games as well as some good soloable titles.

I've condensed the expansions down into one box as much as possible. If a game on the shelf has an expansion it's likely in there.

I tried to arrange the games by shelf, but it's not a perfect system as you fill one and have space elsewhere.

Not shown: Catan, a few smaller games like The Crew, and my painted miniatures cabinet. I have all released blood bowl teams, and I think I'm 3 teams behind in assembling and painting, so I'm doing pretty good with the painting backlog. I also play Marvel Crisis Protocol and pick up most of those releases. Also doing fairly well keeping up on the backlog there.

# Shelves:

Top shelf is basically the heavier or solo games.

Second from the top has most of the family weight, casual games

Third shelf down has more of the ""next step"" middle weight games as well as a few lighter titles

Fourth shelf has the odd box sizes and some random stuff. The one with a lock printed on it is Kingdom Rush. Mechs vs Minions (all painted) and Hoplomachus are obscured in the photo.

bottom shelf: To cull pile and random stuff. A few Magic Commander decks and some pre-built Netrunner decks I assembled.

Floor: Pitch Car tub filled to the brim. A few custom made pieces like my own loop and such.

# Kallax

travel bag on top to carry blood bowl or Marvel minis.

Tube has my custom printed vinyl blood bowl pitches

Batman Gotham City Chronicles: I know it's divisive, but we love it. I have all of the villains painted so far. This game was heading towards the cull list, but the third season has a solo option coming that has kept it on the shelf.

Full collection of Marvel Champions in dividers (hero cards) and encounter cards (card box).

Full Lord of the Rings LCG arranged the same way

Full Netrunner collection: I only bought a few releases for that game, but they made the cards public. I was able to print them for free at my brother's print shop, so it cost me about $100 in sleeves to get the entire collection.

Blood Bowl pitches and rule books

Next to Gloomhaven is my dicemasters storage solution. Each tray pulls out. Dice are arranged at an angle in rows. Dicemasters is probably leaving the collection, tho.

# My personal top ten:

1. Blood Bowl
2. Star Wars Rebellion - would be #1 if I played it as much as Blood Bowl.
3. Gloomhaven
4. A Feast for Odin - purchased in the last year. Rocketed to the top 5. So good.
5. Spirit Island
6. Great Western Trail
7. Lord of the Rings LCG
8. Merchants and Marauders
9. Roll Player
10. Marvel Champions

# Most played:

Lord of the Rings, LCG by a mile

Blood Bowl

Marvel Champions

Gloomhaven

Just One

Codenames

# To cull list:

Paper Dungeons: didn't hit for me

Fallout: I picked up the solo expansion but it's just not a game I wanna pull off the shelf

King of New York

Dice Town

Twilight Struggle: (I know I know, but it's just not being played)

# The culled games of days gone by that were complete purchase mistakes:

Age of Conan: what a slog. Had some weird stuff going on.

B-29 Superfortress: nope, not a war gamer

Charterstone: didn't land at all for us

First martians: hated it. There's something better about Robinson Crusoe's building up vs First Martians damage control.

Kingsburg: found it completely boring

Mansions of Madness 2nd edition: the shine wore off so quickly.

Myth: terrible game

Return of the Heroes: outdated

Rising Sun: hated the bidding mechanic

Space Infantry: not my thing

7th continent: I hated the rinse/repeat do everything again thing

Tainted Grail: OMG the story was great but the game part was such a chore.

Now I'm practicing on [boardgamearena.com](https://boardgamearena.com), meeting and play with people. My win rate is just about 50% now... but FYI. That's not really important.

Okay, now we are in the main part.  
As I knew before, a 2-player game is much more controllable but also harder, and more competitive. Literally battle. My main tactics are mostly:  
1/ ""Hit the (tier) 3"", then move to another color at 2 or 3 tier, collect gems and cards that help and related to other that is necessary to win (a.k.a Sprinter). Weakness are, when I got blocked (crucial in 2-players) I f\*\*\* up, and have to slowly work around, wasting turns.   
2/""Be flexible"" which is dependent on the cards. If it seems to not ""related"" I get stuck and just... work around? 

So I need some advises on:  
1/ The no.1 tactic, what should I do when I got blocked and contingency plans to win?  
2/ Also, another weakness of mine is I reluctant to block other players (I used to do that back then), but how should you block to not choke yourself later on?  
3/ How to be more ""flexible"" in the game?  
4/ Is there any other strategies that I didn't know instead of the ""Hit the 3"" (which seems effective for less turn, high value/points)? Honestly, 4 years ago mostly everyone in our circle play that game and they block each other to prevent that. Yet I want to know some other way too.

boardgames,I created a Catan Cities &amp; Knights scorecard / dice tracker in Excel.

boardgames,Essen 2021 - how did the games I bought there fare?,False,100,0,"Essen 2021 – a haul retrospective

2021 was my first Essen, and I think we can all agree that new people are more prone to excess that those who have been around the block a few times – enter your kind narrator. Given that it was my first Essen, I felt that I had to buy all the games that looked good or otherwise fear that I would never again be able to find them. The FOMO really got to me. Luckily I’ve now seen that not to be the case at all (not even the promos were exclusive to Essen!), meaning that I can go to Essen 2022 with a noticeably lower desire to acquire. However, I thought it might be fun to take a look at the games I bought at Essen 2021 and see how well they fared in my collection. 
For this, I’ll be talking about the games I’ve bought, the number of plays they each had and my reviews in brief. Should you be curious about specific games, feel free to drop a comment. 

**Art Robbery** – 10 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Art Robbery is one of the filler-type games that gets the most play around my house. I’ve got the teach down to a slim two minutes, and I’ve also got the soundtrack down pat. It really is quite Knizia. I still stand by most of the stuff I’ve said in my review, except for the fact that I have had some games of this that were not fun for everyone. I’m A-ok with people consistently stealing my stuff, because I find it hilarious and the game will be over in ten minutes anyway. However, I have had games where people are consistently frustrated that they don’t draw cards that let them do anything they feel is meaningful while consistently getting their stuff stolen. Touch with caution. 

**Golem** - 5 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! I wrote a long piece where I analyzed the cultural history in this game, and I stand by most of what I said there. That said, I have encountered some real problems that stop me from getting it to the table more. The teach is an absolute BEAR, mostly because the game is such an icon soup. I’m also finding that the core gameplay loop is becoming less and less satisfying the more times I play it, because there’s such little interaction. I can see this getting the axe in the future. 

**LUNA Capital**- 5 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! I bought this game mostly because a number of YouTube people were raving about it and I found the artwork cute, but I ended up not liking the core gameplay that much. The tile tower is fiddly, even though you would expect that not to matter that much, and the stuff with the cards… I would just rather be playing Azul, which I feel covers much the same ground while being a lot more streamlined and transparent. Bit of a dud for me, this one. 

**MicroMacro Crime City – full house** - 1 play  
Do I still own it: I do! Mostly because we haven’t really gotten around to playing this one much. I really like MicroMacro though, so I’m just saving this one for a rainy day. I like the little quality of life improvements for families now that they have added little icons that indicate what type of case you can expect, as it helps parents who want to play together with their kids make more educated choices of what type of content they want to expose their kids to. 

**Mindbug** - 4 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! It ended up being too thin for me. The main draw of this game was that it was kind of like squeezing all the water and fat out of Magic the Gathering, ending up with this super sleek game that could be taught and played in mere minutes. For me though, the end result was a game that just didn’t really do much for me. It felt a little bland, like some soul was missing. A soul that can’t be plastered over by any kind of goofy artwork. 

**MOON ADVENTURE** - 7 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! I did really like Moon Adventure, but I just don’t really play that many cooperative games. This one in particular felt really hard to do well, as the Ion Storms can just absolutely mess you up even though you’ve been very careful. I like the core system (which is why I do still own Deepsea Adventure), but this cooperative take did not end up setting my world on fire. 

**Railroad Ink Challenge – Lush Green** - 6 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! I really like this one! Railroad Ink is always nice and mindful, and I’m pretty much always satisfied with the end result. There’s just something very soothing about making a little train route, even though this one does a good job of putting on the pressure more. I personally prefer the trails expansion over the trees expansion, even though both are good. This is also the version of Railroad Ink Challenge that I recommend people get. It’s a good game! 

**SCOUT** - 4 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Scout is just a great, great, great little game, as you may have been told over the last few months. The cardplay feels really fun, I like the theme well enough (my SO and I made it a tradition to tell the other players the names of the cards we’ve played) and there’s something unique about the cards in this game. Recommended, assuming there will be a time where you can actually acquire it. 

**The Siege of Runedar** - 6 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! The Siege of Runedar was REALLY FUN while it lasted though. I didn’t end up falling in love with the core system, and the lack of variability (besides difficulty) ended up killing the game for me. Each game played much too similarly, which ended up with me using the same strategies over and over again. I had my fun exploring the system, so now it’s time to pass it onto someone else. 

**Whitehall Mysteries** - 3 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Whitehall Mysteries, to me, is just the strictly superior version of the Letters to Whitechapel system. It’s lean, it’s easy to understand, it’s quick, it’s incredibly tense; I really do love it a lot. It is currently my favourite hidden movement game, although I’ve heard good things about Sniper Elite and MIND MGMT. I’ve got Beast underway from Kickstarter sometime before December, we’ll wait and see if that game can claim the title. As it stands though, Whitehall Mysteries really is what I love about the system as a whole. It’s tense, excruciating turns followed either by having the cops on your heels or feeling like you’re a criminal mastermind. I cannot recommend this game enough, even though I realize that it is quite difficult to get at the moment.   

**FINAL SCORE**  
Games bought: 10  
Games still in collection: 6  

Not a bad score actually! There’s some games on here that I’m a little salty about (mostly LUNA Capitol) and one that I can see leaving in the not-so-distant future (Golem), but as it stands I do feel that this is a pretty good score. Having said that, I do feel it important to again emphasize (to myself as much as others, to be honest) that Essen should not only be about acquiring new games but also about simply playing and enjoying the con. Last year I went by myself; this year I will be going together with three of my friends. I cannot wait to share this whole new experience with them.

2. Deal With the Devil

4. Ready, Set, Bet!

It’s Jono from Wild Robot Games back again to continue my series of posts about the development of our game Patriot. The idea of these posts is to share the trials, tribulations and mistakes we’ve made during the development of our game including the process up to our upcoming launch day on [Kickstarter on October 5th](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/patriotboardgame/patriot?ref=2gj2j0).

https://www.reddit.com/r/BoardgameDesign/comments/wdanu8/diaries_of_a_board_game_designer_part_1/

Today I want to talk about **logistics and fulfillment**. This is a large area with particular importance to our backers as it decides whether the games will reach them economically, in good time and in one piece. This was one of the first things we decided to tackle when we started this project and we made a poor choice at first when working through the issues.

To set the scene, we anticipate:

* Our backers will be primarily based in the USA
* Approximately 20-25% of backers will be European/ UK
* Any Oceania based backers we will be able to send directly from our homes in Australia

Initially we did minimal research and met with logistics/ fulfillment partners that were aligned with manufacturers we were talking to based in the USA. Whilst the people at these logistics partners were very helpful to establish some initial thought processes, they were missing key factors that we were not yet aware of. Initially, we selected a provider that we weren’t aware had a less than stellar reputation due to their helpfulness in establishing initial thought processes. What we didn’t realise was that the cost of their service and their reputation for helping our customers was not peak industry standard as we had been searching for. Additionally, they were presenting a USA based only strategy which would mean very expensive fulfillment for our European backers when VAT and higher shipping fees from the USA are taken into account. Ultimately, what we thought would be helpful advice turned out to be more of a sales pitch, perhaps a bit naive from us to expect anything else but the tone of communication presented more friendly than business. 

When we realised our mistake we had to restart the process of choosing a fulfillment provider or providers that were recognised as industry leaders in service and would deliver our games in a good state to our backers. Over the last couple years there has been a huge amount of movement in this industry due to COVID and the war in Ukraine which has made it very difficult to find up to date information.

**USA &amp; NA Fulfillment** 

USA &amp; Canadian fulfillment is a much simpler process than many other places in the world as the import charges are easier to deal with and assistance is readily available from the fulfillment providers. Fulfillment in the US is a highly competitive market with many companies to choose from. Shipping charges are well established, competitive and turnaround times are relatively quick. There are a few providers that are commonly referred to as industry leaders for the Kickstarter space across various articles we found online, in particular Fulfillrite and Quartermaster Logistics. We spoke to both companies and chose to go with Fulfillrite based on the response times we received to our queries, however both companies are very knowledgeable and helpful. Both companies also provided quotes to fulfill games worldwide, however the pricing is far greater than local fulfillment and we therefore chose to split fulfillment with a EU based provider and completing Oceanic fulfillment ourselves. 

**UK &amp; EU Fulfillment**

In particular there has been significant changes to the way VAT is dealt with for imported goods. In order to ensure we were across the recently changed VAT processes for imported goods in the EU we conducted a significant amount of research before contacting EU based fulfillment providers. In particular the Stonemaier games articles, whilst now out of date, provided an excellent starting point for this. I’ll link them below:

https://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter-lesson-47-this-project-is-eu-friendly/ 

Upon contacting our chosen European fulfillment partner they provided us with some extremely useful information in relation to the requirements for VAT on Kickstarter fulfillment for creators outside the EU, in particular for fulfillment from the UK. Below is the key passage as I had difficulty finding this information up-to-date elsewhere. 

*VAT in the UK: The UK now requires all publishers outside of the UK who are making sales to UK backers to become VAT registered in the UK, charge the appropriate VAT at point of Sale, then report this back to HMRC on a quarterly basis. You will also be required to obtain a UK EORI (Economic Operators Registration and Identification) Number to allow import into the UK. VAT registration in the UK is relatively simple with your application and quarterly reporting all being made online through the government gateway platform. There is no cost associated with registration or filing.

VAT in the EU: The EU also requires the charging of VAT at point of sale to all customers in the EU at the applicable regional rates.

A new system has been introduced to assist publishers with the collection and reporting of this VAT known as IOSS (Import One Stop Shop) – Under this system you are required to register and report your Sales VAT for all orders under 150EUR on a monthly basis. This registration will then allow you to send parcels from the UK to EU with no additional customs charges at the border. Shipments over 150EUR Value will be required to ship via a DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) service with the Sales VAT paid at the border by the courier directly and charged back to you.*

The EU Registration for IOSS is unfortunately more complicated than for the UK and requires fiscal representation in the EU to complete and provide your monthly filing, this does work out to be quite expensive.

Luckily, many fulfillment providers are now offering a service to submit EU VAT returns on creators behalf so that EU VAT registration is not required. This means that the VAT registration fees that would usually be required to be maintained to transact in Europe are able to be covered by the fulfillment provider. In the case of UK shipments, VAT declarations are required to be undertaken to HRMC quarterly by the seller (in this case, us), however there is no cost associated with this unless VAT has been collected in that quarter. In our case this made EU friendly fulfillment a reality, as the costs and processes to establish an EU entity and register for EU VAT would otherwise be prohibitive for our margin. 

**How do I become EU friendly and what does that even mean?**

EU friendly shipping means that packages in EU are delivered on a DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) basis. VAT &amp; import charges are collected prior to the package being sent to the purchaser and remitted on their behalf so that these changes are not required to be settled in order to receive the package on their end. This requires either:

* Registering for VAT in your own right, which comes with a monthly registration fee and likely accountants fees to arrange remittance of these charges
* Arranging for someone else to emit these charges on your behalf (if possible)

In our case, as described above, our UK &amp; EU fulfillment partner is arranging for the remittance of these charges on behalf of our backers. 

Often the phrase EU friendly shipping is associated with shipping from an EU location to limit the shipping expense, whilst this isn’t actually included in the original definition it will likely be required in order to properly deal with VAT on an EU friendly basis, as is the case with our campaign. 

**Our key learnings**

* The providers in this space are the best place to get current information. Whilst there is a bit of irony in me saying this in a post sharing our experiences, the logistics and fulfillment industry changes very rapidly and articles online quickly become out of date. Contacting providers directly gave us a far better picture than trying to research purely online, in particular providers we found that had a good reputation with other board game publishers. 
* Even though the fulfillment cost is largely borne by the backers, it’s still a significant gate in whether they will back the game and needs to be treated with respect. Our initially chosen provider would have meant that the cost of our game to backers outside the US would be roughly double, with the cost of shipping being almost as much as the game for EU based backers. This potentially would be a blocker for 20-25% of our backers who are anticipated to be outside the US, ultimately affecting our profitability due to potentially decreased manufacturing numbers. 
* Despite first impressions, including EU based fulfillment is actually an economically viable option. It felt easy at the start to write off EU based fulfillment due to the complexities, but working through the issues will help us run a successful (hopefully!) campaign.

boardgames,Creating a digital board game,False,9,0,"Hello everybody !

I'm trying to create a board game that's playable on a phone or at least on a computer. I have the board, rules and everything. It's a basic game with pawn moving forward according to the results of a dice, and each tile triggers an effect in real life on the players (It's a party game). Is there a platform to create this game with a built-in tool, or do I have to start from scratch on unity or something like that ?

boardgames,Favorite dog-themed boardgame,False,6,0,"I recently purchased Dog Lover. We bought it for cute theme, but we really like it for simplicity, smooth playstyle and fair replayability.
What is your favorite dog/pet-themed boardgame and why?",,15,,6,,public
boardgames,"Games where you build something (landscapes, towns, patterns) - which games are your favorites and why?",False,26,0,"I really love games where I can build or create something. It can be in a more abstract sense, e.g. engine building (Race for the Galaxy, Terraforming Mars), or more literal, where you create a landscape, like Cascadia. I wanna talk about the latter. Disclaimer: this is all very subjective and when I'm critical of ones aspect of a game, it doesn't mean I don't like the game (e.g. Terraforming Mars) or not even that I don't like the look overall (e.g. Everdell might be the best looking game I have).

Over time I noticed a a few preferences of mines: 

1. Obviously a game has to be sound mechanically and be fun, but aesthetics are really important to me. Take **Terraforming Mars** or the map in **Ark Nova**, for example. It gets the job done, but it isn't fun to look at it. TM also lacks variety (ocean, greenery, city). **Cascadia** is nothing groundbreaking in this regard, but it's nice to look at and I enjoy figuring out how to place the next tile. 

2. The (subjectively) right theme makes a big difference, too. **Azul** looks fantastic, but what am I even doing? IIRC it is about producing tiles, however, it doesn't matter for the gameplay, I'm just putting the tiles where they need to go with little rhyme or reason. It's not satisfying. Games like **Cascadia** (nature + animals) and **Kingdomino** let me build a landscape. **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** lets me build a castle and even if I think it could look nicer, 

3. A downside of all this is that disturbing the pattern, even if advantageous gameplay-wise, is unsatisfying. When playing **Kingdomino** I always shied away from taking the swamp(?) tiles, i.e. the light brown ones. I often just call it ""mud"". 

4. Despite #3, I much prefer games where it's possible to ""screw up"" like this over games where I don't care if I interrupt a pattern. Because if I don't care about it, it also means I don't enjoy making these patterns in the first place. Maybe not the perfect example, but **Kanagawa** fits the bill for me. The cards are nice, but I find myself somewhat indifferent to the painting I'm creating. **Everdell** looks amazing, but the town I'm building...well, visually it doesn't feel like I'm building a town, I'm putting cards down next to each other.

If I had to sum my sentiment, I would say it comes down to this: can I be happy with my game even if I lose, maybe even badly? Can I look at my board and be content with what I created?",,39,,26,race-for-the-galaxy,public
boardgames,Board Game Storage/Display Shelf,False,13,0,"I'm looking to get a shelf to display my game collection in my living room. I'm considering the Billy shelf from Ikea which is 11"" deep.

boardgames,Azul: how do I calculate probability of a factory having at least 3 blues?,False,17,0,"I started wondering this today but I haven't touched this kind of math for quite a while...

Say, with the initial board setup with 2 players (20 per color, 5 factories).

What's the probability of having at least one factory with at least 3 blues?

I think I know how to calculate for the first factory (choosing 4 tiles from a 100):

(20 choose 3) \* (80 choose 1) / (100 choose 4) + (20 choose 4) / (100 choose 4)

But with 4 other factories, it seems to get complicated.

Ultimately, I'd like to generalize it to any board setup. Say, in second round, with a distribution of \[16, 17, 15, 12, 20\], probability of at least k etc.

Thanks!

**Edit:** Wow. Thanks for your wonderful answers. That was a fun thought exercise. TLDR seems like a hard problem and writing a simulation is the easiest. Will write one and report back.  
**Edit 2:** For those interested, as suggested, I wrote a simple program to simulate a 2p board of azul and gotten the following probability after sampling 20 tiles from 100 tiles for 10M times.   
\- number of factories that have at least 1 blue: 29836914 (59.67%)  
\- number of factories that have at least 2 blues: 8878900 (17.76%)  
**- number of factories that have at least 3 blues: 1223261 (2.45%)**  
\- number of factories that have at least 4 blues: 61944 (0.12%)  
Note: Since there are 5 factories each round, so the denominator for calculating the percentage is 50M.

boardgames,Betrayal at House on the Hill - how do the editions differ and which is best?,False,5,0,"After watching some playthroughs and with spooky season upon us, I’m looking at acquiring Betrayal at House on the Hill. There are three editions of the game out the. The first two editions are readily available secondhand (which I generally prefer because of environmental and financial benefits). The third however just came out this year and I cannot find secondhand locally (the Netherlands).

My question is, do the editions differ much in experience or rules? Obviously the artwork has been updated but is there anything else that would make it worth spending double the €€€ on a new 3rd edition rather than purchasing a secondhand 2nd edition?

Any input would be much appreciated!

Broom Service does feel Halloweeny - even though you are not doing anything scary/ spooky/ evil in the game, just that it's based around witches. Conversely, Quacks of Quedlinburg, despite being wizards putting things into cauldrons - very Halloween - doesn't.   

In the fantasy genre, it's even more subtle. ""Welcome To the Dungeon"" feels Halloween - creeping into a deep dark dungeon with goblins and skeletons in it but Descent obviously isn't, despite going into a deep dark dungeon with goblins and skeletons. 

Some games are 'Halloween feeling' because they 'feel' scary, dark, spooky, tense, and others do just because of the theming.

boardgames,Dwellings of Eldervale 2nd Edition?,False,20,0,"So I wanted to ask about Dwellings on this reddit to see if someone has a clue about it. I've read that they are going to release a second edition and it should be in September, but the month is ending and I have not seen or read any news, maybe I should search on the right place, but what better place than reddit itself",,14,,20,,public
boardgames,Miniature Market Customer Service TERRIBLE. What's the best alternative?,False,0,0,"I used to get excellent customer service from Miniature Market. They were my go to place to order games from. Well, they got bought, and then moved their warehouse, and I've been waiting over a month for a customer release. I've sent in several requests for update, and the last communication I got from them said they were prioritizing my order, and that it should be shipped out in 1-3 days. That was sent a week ago. 

I am, at this point, completely done with them. Does anyone have recommendations for an alternative site for a US shopper with good prices, and that does customer holds?",,13,,0,,public
boardgames,Blood Rage vs Rising Sun,False,12,0,"Thinking of buying one of these games and wanted to know which one is better? My game group typically play with 5 players and highly competitive and enjoy games where you can feel a sense of accomplishment even if you lose. We have loved playing Caverna, 7 wonders, Catan, and Scythe (but some hated how it ends abruptly).

Also, does anyone know why Rising Sun seems to be out of stock in Australia?

Edit: Finally got my copy of Rising Sun! Found someone on facebook who sold his copy with all expansions (including daimyo box and neoprene mat) for just AUD300 (~USD200). He put up his ad just hours after I posted this. So lucky! Would probably still look into blood rage after but for now I’ll enjoy this serendipitous moment.",,35,,12,,public

##FAQ

**I live in Haiti/Canada/Costa Rica/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the Nigerian prince won't answer my emails anymore!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on WAAAGH!, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

boardgames,Trying to find out the name of this marble based game - any help would be great!,False,16,0,"Hi! My dad has been on the search for the name of this board game forever. He’s tried Googling it and has found nothing. I’ve also tried googling it and found nothing.

He thinks it might be Italian but that’s the only clue we have and could be wrong.

It’s a long board with 14 marbles on each side and it has marble-shaped holes drilled all down the length of the board in rows. It starts with each side having a row of 5, then 4, and then 5 again from the bottom of each side of the board. (It could be 4-3-4 but I think it’s 5-4-5.) The board then continues in alternating rows of 5 and 4 holes all the way to the other side.  

The goal is to get your marbles on the other side, but you can only move a marble by one space or by bouncing your marbles over other marbles. If there’s a long chain, your marble has unlimited bounces and can bounce over the other side. You can bounce over your own marbles or the other persons.

I wonder about replayability, I read your progress can be saved and that makes it really easy to pick where you left but it also mentions that you can play with different groups, does that mean you can play it many times without it being repetitive?

I was wondering if any of you had any recs with games similar to these two, either card supported, board, drawing.etc. where the narrative build-up with prompts takes more importance than a clear win/lose scenario, but that isn't a pure rpg.

Context: in both these games the main mechanic is getting a prompt from a card to further the story, add more context to the character you might be playing, or the world building (with the quiet year also being supported by map-drawing)

boardgames,Tips and advice for a after school board games club,False,32,0,"Hello all, as the title suggests I'm hoping to run an after school board games club. The session will be roughly an hour and 15 minutes, once a week. 

Some background: I work at a UK school, and the club will be aimed at key stage two (7-10 years old roughly). 

I just wanted some ideas, advice and any board game recommendations that I haven't thought of myself.

Obviously my first session will be more about getting to know the kids, their experiences and what they've played and anything they'd like to try. I will also be writing a contract with some simple guidelines and expectations as a lot of the games will be from my own collection. 

The games that I own and I am thinking of using are: 
Dobble 
Speedy words 
Cobra paw 
Timeline 
Anomia 
Dominoes 
Top trumps 
Guess who 
Colour brain 
Herd mentality 
Word on the street 
Abalone 
Machi koro 
Love letter 
Marrakech 
Codenames 
5 second rule 

If you can suggest any others that would be great. I am of course going to have the basic and easy to play games like snakes and ladders, etc. As each week I will focus on introducing one new game and teach it to a group and then help them to teach it to the other members.",,16,,32,,public
boardgames,Kemet Blood and Sand components question,False,7,0,"hello,

I recently acquired a new copy of Kemet Blood and Sand. Most everywhere I have seen, the rule book and back of the box lists ""5 Player Aids"" included. edit: the back of my retail box also says ""5 Player Aids"" included

However, my retail copy only came with 3 Player Aids and the included rule book only lists 3 Player Aids in the components.

Has anyone else experienced this? I know on the KS Page, Matagot/Asmodee lists ""5 Player Aids in the core box"" so I am a bit confused.

boardgames,Great Western Trail 2E “Grinder” Action,False,10,0,"Today ended a ridiculously high scoring game: 155 to 128. I used the “grinder” action (back up the train to run a cow over) to whittle down my starter deck to 1 of each cow except 2 Galloways to get a little extra cash at the hiring market. Within a short time, between ribbons and my thin deck I was scoring a minimum 19 points every time I made it around the board. 

When we were picking up, I noticed the grinder icon in 2E doesn’t have a -1 cost… it appears it pays you a coin! Is that correct?  (I can’t find my rule book.)

Was also curious what people think about the 2E balance on the ribbons, engineers and grinding mechanics. At least in 2P, I felt like scoring early engineers and ribbons gave me a run away victory.",,10,,10,,public

Important- They both insist on playing, will even plan/host game nights and pick the games.

One of them gets chatty about irl situations/opinions, not pay attention to other’s moves or plan ahead (and pulls his convo partner out of the game mentally too), stalls the game on his turn for 10-20 minutes to continue the chat, and repeatedly even admits and laughs when he does so. Even the lightest of games turns into a slog.

The other stalls with massive AP, and will often rewind moves (sometimes 2-3 times) to min max the outcome before he passes.

They’re both friends, and the AP time traveler is my main connection to a larger group of gamers.

I’ve mentioned politely it’s their turn. I’ll put a soft time frame on a game by mentioning I need to leave around a certain time. I’ve reduced my attendance to some game nights, but would like to still join them.

boardgames,Legendary Encounters Alien - Not sure about a second play,False,3,0,"My wife and have been enjoying deck building games. Clank!, Clank! In Space, and Star Realms have been replayed a ton in the couple of months since we got into the hobby.

She read about Legendary Encounters and heard the Alien version was generally regarded as one of the better ones so we picked it up off eBay.

Upon opening it up we were a bit overwhelmed by the contents. The amount of cards wasn't the issue, it was the contempt the game maker seemed to have for the players by not making the backs of cards that belong in separate decks different colors. In addition, the rule book does a poor job of explaining the various decks. We found a great guide on the internet to get things organized and ready to play. Without that guide I shudder to think how long setup would have taken.

By the time we had things organized we decided not to play that evening since it was such a slog.

We got back to it a day or two later and played a round after watching some videos on YouTube to get the general gameplay mechanics down.

We never felt enjoyment from the round we played. The rules were vague in some areas and it took us a bit to figure out a couple things after reading particular rules a few times. The lack of variety in the deck building cards made turns feel repetitive and uninteresting for the most part.

I was unharmed at one point and a couple turns later was dead do to some unfortunate timing some cards came out, which I didn't actually mind as it made the scenario feel more realistic in some ways. We are battling an Alien after all.

My wife ended up winning by the skin of her teeth and the last couple of turns leading up to the win were the best part of the session since there definitely was some suspense as to whether she'd pull it off or not.

It's been a week since we played and we said we'd go back for another play to see if we like it any better, but I'm not sure I want to. It was such a grind to organize and get setup, then the game itself didn't seem that great.

Are we crazy to not give this game another chance? Is the Marvel version significantly better and maybe we just bought the wrong version? I'd love to hear from other people that like and dislike the Alien version.",,24,,3,,public

boardgames,Classic kids games with twists to make them fun for drunk adults,False,4,0,"Hi everyone,

I'm planning a party for my 30th in a couple of months and have taken inspiration from No Rolls Barred's EXCELLENT House Rules series where they play classic kids/family games with a twist to make them more ridiculous or entertaining for adults. I'd like to have a whole suite of these available for people to play at the party and wondered if anyone has any ideas I could use to flesh out the selection?

So far, mostly ripped shamelessly from House Rules, I've got:

Handcuff Twister:
Twister played in teams of two (plus a third to spin the dial). Players are handcuffed together. If one player's handcuffed hand comes up on the dial, the other player's handcuffed hand is freed from its previous position. 

Guess Who with Vibes Only:
Guess who, but you can't ask anything to do with their physical appearance. E. G. 'is their dad proud of them?' 'have they had a threesome?' 

Operation Blindfold:
Operation in teams of two. One player is blindfolded and their teammate has to guide them to the right spot with their voice. Constant sudden death rules. 

Giant Jenga with boxing/other incapacitating gloves

Any ideas for other games? I've steered away from House Rules' video of Battleships where you take a shot every turn as I'd rather have games with rules twists which are more fun after a few drinks rather than being drinking games in and of themselves. 

Other game inspirations I have are below, but haven't got a suitable rules twist for any of them yet:

boardgames,Dixit Rules Question,False,14,0,"I've owned Dixit for years now and have never faced this situation until a few weeks ago.

My wife and two friends and I were playing a 4 player game of the ""race to 30 points"" Dixit edition. My wife had 29 points. I had 28 points. The other two players were no where near 30 points.

On the last turn of the game, my wife was the active player. She gave a clue that referenced a topic I was familiar with, and I was pretty sure the other two players were not.

Given that I was likely the only person who could both provide a decent red herring and deduce which card was hers, I gambled and made the decision to intentionally vote for a card that *wasn't* hers. 

It paid off. The other two players missed her clue and picked each other's cards, and I also picked one of theirs. Since no one picked the correct card, everyone but my wife received 2 points and I won the game.

Besides my questionable decision to anger my wife, I'm not sure if I did anything wrong. The rules *do* state that ""the goal of the players is to find the active player's card"" and to ""vote in secret for the card he/she thinks is the active player's."" 

But in the above situation, this conflicts with the overall goal of the game — to reach 30 points. It's also an unenforceable rule (maybe I *did* think that was her card after all). Should I knowingly lose the overall game by choosing correctly, or is it okay to be incorrect to win the overall game?

I'm sure many will say that this is way too complicated and gamey for a game like Dixit. And you're absolutely right. But my wife and I are competitive people, so I'd still love to know what other people think!",,17,,14,,public

I have around 70+ board games. None of them were taken. I counted :D. The strange thing is, I had many valuable board games (some of them painted by myself) and the burglar took some items, which were way less valuable than board games.  

 So, I guess, board games are safe and decent investments and burglar proof :D At least in my case, they were.

boardgames,Six New Games!!,False,30,0,"Yesterday, our box arrived here in Zimbabwe, from the UK, with six new games in it (https://youtube.com/shorts/qXtRORX-LIg?feature=share)

We picked up:

• Skulls of Sedlec

• Sprawlopolis

• Skull King

• Kariba

• Regicide (played with standard decks before but I love the art)

• Tiny Epic Kingdoms


So far:

Skulls of Sedlec is awesome. My wife is a big ""skull"" fan. Slap a skull on it and she wants it. We played five rounds yesterday at 2 and 3 player, and I'm in love. It's one of those games where the limitations (one action, two card hand size) are frustrating in a good way. Easy to play, rules are easy to memorize due to the theme, and I love the art.

I've played three solo games of Sprawlopolis, won one, lost two. Delightfully thinky, works well as solo and I'm keen to try multiplayer. Astonished at how small this game is but how big it feels. Worried it might ""grow old"" when I've seen all the objectives, but I guess there are then a tonne of expansions 😅

Skull King. Not played yet, but it sounds amazing and everyone I know who's played it races about it. As my wife is to skulls, I am to pirates. Put a pirate on the box and I'm in. Rulebook suggests leaving mermaids in, but reviews all talk of the ""base game"" being without them? Also seems like there's a TONNE of scope for different modes, etc. Keen to try this at the weekend with the crew.

The second I saw Kariba, I knew I had to get it. Lake Kariba is in Zimbabwe, and I love several of Reiner Knizia's other games (including Loot, of course). Seems weird to name a waterhole game about a lake, but I guess ""Hwange"" (whilst Zimbabwean and technically more fitting) doesn't have the same ring to it. Box is smaller than I anticipated (which is cool) and the game sounds easy fun. Looking forward to teaching our live-in niece and nephew!

Not much to say about Regicide. I love the game in general, have only played solo before. The art on the ""official"" deck is just gorgeous and I think will help remind players of what the different suits do. Of course, we COULD use it for standard card games, but I think a round of Egyptian Rat Screw might just wreck the deck, so I'll stick to a standard Bicycle deck for that, haha! 

Tiny Epic Kingdoms surprised me actually. We've played a LOT of Galaxies, Dinosaurs, Zombies, Pirates, and Dungeons, and I was surprised at how slim Kingdoms is (no stacks of cards?) I've only played a single 1v1 against my wife, so far, but I really enjoyed the pace, the versatility of the races, and how quick the game plays. We didn't use the Exploration mini-expansion in our first game, which I think we will use in our first group game this weekend. My only quibble is that war seems really... Obvious? I like that there's no RNG, but I can easily read my opponents race cards and see if war is worth it. I guess the point is to sometimes throw a meeple at them just to get them to burn resources as you immediately surrender? Intrigued to play more of this.

Have you played any of these? Do you enjoy them? Would love to hear your thoughts too!",,10,,30,,public

boardgames,War of the ring rules explanation,False,8,0,"Hey I was playing and had several questions to clarify.  
When playing free people, when you take damage from a battle, can you demote an elite if you have no regulars left or can you take a regular from the “dead” pile or does it take it from the fresh recruits. 

Also with Nazgûl’s can you recruit them with a muster die and if so, and Nazgûl’s get killed, can you revive them and spawn them again. 

My other question would be when attacking a stronghold that hasn’t had people hiding yet for instance my friend had 8 regular/elite units on minas tirith, does this attack only allow hits on 6 still or do the free people get punished for having a fight outside their stronghold and get hit by 5’s. 

Also if a fight happens outside the stronghold, can the party inside the stronghold fight the army on top of them or are they not allowed to move at all until a shadow army is not on top of them. 

For the hunt, let’s say I have 3 eyes in the eyes hunt before the fellowship move. The player moves the fellowship now for the first time. Do I immediately roll for those 3 die and only hit on 6’s and roll again if he has moved again on this turn rotation and now I hit on 5’s and if he moves again I roll and draw on if I hit at least one four.

boardgames,[Vast: the Crystal Caverns] Goblin's 'Trap' secret interaction with the Knight's attack,False,12,0,"I don't understand how the Goblin's 'Trap' secret works when the Knight attacks the Goblin. As far as I understand, the Knight gets to *enter* a tribe's square when her Strength is **greater than** the tribe's Strength. *Afterwards* they have to use an encounter to attack the tribe, causing them to scatter.

But as far as I can figure out, there is no further mention of Strength being used during the attack. So the Strength of a tribe only appears to matter in barring the Knight from entering the square.

However, now my Knight with 3 Strength enters a square with a 2 Strength tribe. I proceed to attack that tribe. My opponent points to their Trap secret and mentions that their Strength increases during the attack and is now also at 3… but for what purpose?

Does my Knight now lose the attack? Does the tribe still scatter? Should my Knight have been able to enter the square at all?

What is the correct interaction with the 'Trap' secret?

**Update:**

After asking [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/brunoscheele/status/1572607853655130113), Leder Games' social came back with the [following answer on another forum](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1658280/article/24011805#24011805);

&gt;You play it face up in front of you during your turn.  
The Knight can only enter the space if the attack would succeed, so the one extra strength makes it harder for the Knight to attack.  
If it is discarded to block a Dragon attack the attack doesn't do anything.

boardgames,So I played Dominion for the first time last weekend at my brothers house and I’m in love,False,25,0,"I’m actually a fairly avid board game player (though maybe not compared to a lot of you), so I’m not sure how I’ve managed to miss this game for basically 15 years.  Anyway, my reason for posting is that I want to buy Dominion, but seeing how many versions and expansions there are, I want to make an informed purchase. So now I will provide some context to help you all give me the best possible advice.

I have 3 kids that I play board games with semi-frequently (though not as much as we’d all like), ages 12, 10, and 6.  The 2 older ones are definitely ahead for their ages, and greatly enjoy playing Catan, 7 Wonders, Civ IV A New Dawn (these first 3 are my favorites), Pandemic, Munchkin, many of the Forbidden Island games, Risk, and Stratego.  My 6 year olds favorite games probably shouldn’t factor in, as that will likely change a lot over the next few years.  My wife’s favorite games are social games like Beyond Balderdash, but she also quite likes 7 Wonders and Acquire (high on my list as well).  As a family, we enjoy 5 minute dungeon because the team aspect and it includes the 6 year old.

I also play with a range of adults maybe every other month or so, who would likely enjoy Dominion quite a bit. 

As for cost, perhaps I could justify up to $100, but surely we can spend less than that and get plenty of hours of enjoyment.",,30,,25,,public

boardgames,Opinions on AuZtralia,False,21,0,"I’d been interested in [AuZtralia by Martin Wallace](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/231581/auztralia) since it appeared on the shelves a little while ago, and recently picked up a copy when I saw it on sale.

For those who don’t know, British designer Wallace is very prolific and his many games include Brass, DiscWorld, Steam, London, Via Nebula and A Study in Emerald, and I like some of them but dislike others.

For examples, the rarely-seen or mentioned [Via Nebula](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191231/nebula) has a fascinating blend of map exploration and shared incentives, whereas the otherwise very popular [Brass](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28720/brass-lancashire) seems vastly over-complicated to me. 

A few games in to AuZtralia I’m impressed that the unlikely blend of Lovecraftian horror and early 20th Century Australia doesn’t at all seem forced\*), and his use of Time as an action cost is engaging, adds tension, and is highly thematic. (Time is running out before the Old Ones awaken and rampage across the lands).

For example, towards the end of the game you can spend more Time to build a stronger military force, but might run out of Time (and time) to actually get them in to combat.

Then whilst the rules aren’t difficult to learn, they are complicated (having many parts); the combat and moves for the Old Ones (essentially an automata) are absurdly fiddly, and all the games seem to take twice as long as they ought to.

I haven’t tried a 2-player or solitaire game yet, and suspect the 2-player will need players to start close to one another, and that the game might actually be *better* as a solitaire than with 4 players! 

So it’s a curious game, and I wondered if others with experience of it have any remarks about the way the game develops for players after multiple games, or comments about Wallace’s designs with respect to his other games perhaps?

I'm not springing Gloomhaven, Spirit Island, or anything remotely like that on them.

boardgames,Most fun way to introduce Shadow Hunters/Fangs,False,9,0,"Question to those of you who own Shadow Hunters, or the Fangs re-implementation.

When you introduce the game to a table of newbies, do you show them all the wacky neutral roles being played in that session? I usually don't; I prefer to just get the game started, telling them that there are two main ""teams"" (Shadow vs. Hunters, with pretty clear objectives) and then a small handful of neutral characters who have their own unique win conditions...

...but largely, I let the game unfold as a big surprise (which becomes an even bigger surprise when nobody saw the ""die first"" win condition coming)

The game has been a hit with every group I play with -- but I'm only wondering now, all these years later, whether any of my players ever felt ""cheated"" that a win condition came so far out of left field, without any heads up.

boardgames,"Etiquette questions (three of them), opinions wanted.",False,62,0,"1. So a couple months ago I was trying to teach some family members a relatively easy game as games go (splendor) and I found it pretty challenging to keep them engaged during just the rules portion of the explanation. They repeatedly said things like ""there are soo many rules"" and ""holy crap this is complicated"". This then lead to distracted side conversations about other things, laughing at my difficulty with further breaking down the rules, and the game taking forever to get started. Anybody else had this happen? What did you to about it?

2. Somebody quits out of a game entirely; this particular instance was a bad timing issue. But another person I know occasionally seems to disengage with the game and visibly lose interest, putting less effort into their turns. This brings the whole vibe down and I feel it's super lame. Had this happen? How'd you handle it?

3. Why do people whip out their phones in between every single turn? Even for just a few seconds of scrolling. Then they inevitably are reminded that it's their turn and have to then think about what to do and hold up the flow of the game, leading to more phones coming out. Am I just an old codger in the making or is as annoying as I feel it is?

I gave Viticulture a go, but found the visitor cards not only swingy, but the best strategy for winning. Barrage has come very close, but the WP aspect isn't as central to the game as Agricola's. Uwe's other designs such as Feast for Odin, Caverna, and Fields of Arle don't have the same bite and tension that Agricola has.

I started looking around how the 2v2 variant is played, but it's like no one has ever bothered to share anything about playing SFB as a team game. I've been able to find a single team play video on Youtube and noticed they were playing 2 heroes per player, so that would mean that 4 player games are not supported out of the box.

There is not a single line anywhere, on any website, that indicates that this is the case. All you ever read is ""2-4 players"". This is just blatantly false advertising and I feel it happens way too often in boardgaming. I've already been burned once by Arkham LGC, where I bought a single starter set and realised that for two players to actually have fun you need to waste money on a second starter set. It feels like so many developers are out to trick you, selling starter and core sets that are barely functional and force you to search through message boards to see what else you need for a proper experience.

One (or 2?) tiles are “insta kills”, where if my teammate says it, we automatically lose.

-chicken
-pig
-lettuce
-cow
-milk
-cheese
-water
-cereal
-orange juice
-toothbrush

If chicken is the instakill word, I could tell my teammate “breakfast” as the 1 word hint. My teammate would then hopefully knock out pig, milk, cheese, cereal, orange juice, and toothbrush — gaining 6/10 points total. But let’s say my teammate guessed “chicken” as we’ll, we lost",,12,,13,,public

boardgames,My Dominion storage solution is broken again. I have 2 more full expansions and 3 Upgrade packs to add. What do you guys do to store them all?,False,894,0,,,138,,894,,public
boardgames,Wormholes - interstellar taxi driving,False,22,0,"I haven't really played any 'pick up and deliver' games before playing Wormholes (and I don't doubt that I'll find people who will tell that's still true after having played Wormholes). It's not been a deliberate choice - it's not like I had made a solemn vow never to engage with anything approaching logistical optimisation, but it just happened to pan out there's only two that have really piqued my interest. And, seeing the effusive praise lathered onto Wormholes by Quinten Smith of SUSD fame, I felt like I had to check this one out. 

Before I get into the gameplay, let me talk about what this game is built from. Player pieces look sleek and feel great to touch, the rulebook is nice, clear and *svelte*, and comes with more than enough pieces to do whatever your heart desires during the game. And really, this game is mercifully light on rules; it's almost Knizia-esque in that sense. It's a simple five minute teach and players are ready to fly interstellar tourists off to extraplanetary holiday destinations.

Wormholes, then, is a game where you basically play as rival interplanetary taxi drivers. Each player wants to deliver as many passengers to as many different planets as possible. However, it turns out that space is *huge* and your spaceship is *slow*. ""There has got to be a way around this!"" you scream after spending an entire turn puttering about in your tiny shuttle taxi, inching ever so slowly to your actual destination. And that's where the eponimous wormholes come in. Players will, over the course of the game, create infrastructure in the form of wormholes to massively expedite traveling between points and planets in order to more easily deliver future passengers to planets that have been previously visited. And the tunnels are public, too! Anyone can use your tunnels for the low, low price of just a single point! And honestly, how much is a point really in the grand scheme of things. 

Good wormhole usage (and therefore good wormhole building) really is the difference between a winning game and one where you're feeling kind of lost. It's the difference between same day delivery and feeling like you're stuck in the Suez channel. You want to have access to good tunnels (and a good network of them) to make sure you can actually deliver to those planets you need to hit, and to make sure that it doesn't take you forever to do so. This game really has excellent tempo built in, which is helped along by the player driven game length. 

Each time a player creates the first wormhole next to a planet, they get a reward token and shorten the length of the game just that liiiiittle bit. Once all planets have a wormhole next to them, it's three more turns and then it's done. I really like player-driven tempo as it helps prevent players just sitting around and revving up engines forever until they're just vomiting out buckets of points each turn. This also gives the game a very satisfying have arc, where you start out slow but collectively build up this infrastructure that allows you to zoom across the universe to two or sometimes even three planets by the end of the game. The systems want you to go places, and go there fast! The game is actually very good at incentivising people to go out and explore the galaxy on the table by giving people points for getting to planets first and for going to as many different planets as possible. But really, how much could a few points be? 

So we're approaching the part of the review where the negatives are now. 

With all the things the game does well, there's a few things that I can see as turn-offs for other people. For starters, yes, there is quite some randomness to the game. Wormholes uses its deck to give out objectives for you to chase for points, and you will probably encounter runs off cards that are just better. Having been forged in the fires of competitive Magic the Gathering, I don't really mind; sometimes you draw it and sometimes you don't. That said, I do feel worried about the starting card in particular. Your first delivery/deliveries will probably dictate a lot, and drawing a card that's just flatly on the other side of the universe is disheartening, even if Wormholes does have a very friendly system that allows you to basically dump your hand and draw a new one each turn. It still sucks to realize your neighbours were flying one planet over while you were being sent somewhere a million miles away. 

Then there's also the fact that poor planning or missing a good wormhole can just absolutely destroy you. I've seen it happen multiple times that someone either forgot to drop an entrance somewhere or placed something poorly, only to be forced to spend four turns puttering along while the other players were zipping across the universe raking in points. None of my games have been a blow-out because of it, but it does feel disheartening when you see your opponents breaking the laws of physics while you're on a slow boat stuck in traffic. 

On the topic of scores - I'm unsure how I feel about it. All games I've played had scores closely grouped together, which poses two issues; it disincentives players from using each other's tunnels, and it leads to games where it is impossible to properly evaluate what good play really looks like. The first of these two issues, to me, is the biggest problem that I don't really know how to fix - I'm not sure I even want to. I am however just a little sad that the end game scoring discourages people from interacting with what is arguably the coolest system in the game - the shared tunnel network! The second problem is maybe more of a me problem, but I like to see what actually impressive play looks like. If I play randomly and the other person plays an absolute blinder and we end up, like, three points apart, how do I know what lead to him having a higher score? How will I know what matters?

My last issue is related to player count. The solo mode in this game is absolutely not worth your time - it barely resembles the real game. Two players is fine, if a little 'quiet'. The game really starts to sing at three and four, and at five I think you'll have tipped over to the other side of goodness. I'm not against having a game that works best at three or four, but I would definitely stay away of you primarily intend to play it solo or 2P. While still fun as an experience, I don't think this game offers enough to people mostly playing at a low player count. 

So, with all that said, where do we land on Wormholes? I churn through games pretty aggressively (for example, I've sold and replaced about 1/3rd of my collection so far this year), but I am gladly hanging onto Wormholes. The gameplay loop and game arc feel satisfying and the game looks and feels gorgeous. It's a lovely, inviting and light game that I think will be a bit with groups of three or four looking to have a fun, zoomy and quick time together. However, I'm not really going to pull it out as a dueler and I can't imagine this turning into anyone's favourite game or even game of the year. Grab it for groups looking to have quick fun sort of working together and flying through space.",,4,,22,mage-knight,public

What I enjoy about them is how adaptable they are and you can play with 1-12 relatively easily. This means it gets to hit the table all the time rather than a game like secret Hitler (which is amazing) but only gets to hit the table once every month rather than 3 times a week. 

Are there any other games in this genre you guys would recommend or perhaps even a criticism of the genre would be greatly appreciated.",,32,,1,,public
boardgames,can't remember name of a fun game I played,False,4,0,"About 3 years ago, I was winery hopping with friends in southeast Arizona (Sonoita) and at one of the stops we met a man who pulled out a game with colored playing pieces. He told us the rules, they were very simple. It's multiplayer: 4 ppl played first, then 3 ppl. It was HIGHLY addictive, very fast to play, and easy to develop your own strategy. I'm so sorry that is all I remember with confidence, but here are other details that are fuzzy:

It's some kind of winner-take-all game where the goal is to collect all of your colored pieces (or one of each color??) or cards - likely -  or else get rid of all your pieces or cards (less likely).

I think there was some element of chance as with dice or dealt cards, or both. The dice/cards may have been colored.

There was opportunity to adopt and try out strategies, a way to approach how you would conduct each turn. But strategy options were simple and limited.

I think it was played in one round (as opposed to phase 10 which takes many rounds). It was relatively fast to play, 5-10 minutes. I think it was played in turns. There was no scoring, pretty sure.

It was fairly compact and portable. I mean, the guy was basically taking it from winery to winery on a wine tour bus, and able to play it with strangers on a small picnic table.

I don't remember if it had a board, like a cardboard playing surface, or a wooden pegboard as you might put pegs onto. It might have.

I expect a lot of down votes for this. I'm basically describing every game in the history of games. I'm confident  that I would recognize it by its name, or a photograph, or even a description of gameplay. I'm not an avid/expert board game player, but I have played IMHO a large variety of games and I had never seen this before.

Any takers?",,9,,4,,public

boardgames,I got to play some out of print games and here are my quick thoughts.,False,3,0,"We have a convention here in Grand Rapids, Michigan and I went a couple weeks ago with one goal in mind. I wanted to take as much advantage of the out-of-print games in their library as I could.

**Summit: The Board Game**
**Nova Luna**

boardgames,Card games similar to Magic but last a lot longer?,False,51,0,"My wife and I recently got into Dice Throne and enjoyed it quite a bit. We start with 50-75 life (I think 50 is standard but we like longer games). Either way games with the randomness of dice and decesion making take at least a good 30 minutes. There's a ton of back and forth usually and it feels like a battle. That being said we have most of the characters and were craving something a bit more complex, a bit more variety so we looked into MTG.

Long story short I played Magic 20 years ago and playing competitive with my wife in DT we got interested in Magic. We got started decks, nothing crazy powerful. We are having some fun... but I don't recall the game being so 'quick'. I guess that is the idea, but even with a few decks we are getting bored. There's a little back and forth and again we are not optimized and learning but we've had a few games go into turn 10+ though it seems pointlesss since you end up with tons of land but not many or no cards left in your hand to actually play since the game went on too long, but that is 20% of games. Most games seem over by turn 6 or close too it.

Looking online it seems like most MTG games are shorter at least from stats I read. I dunno know to me 15 minutes into a game turn 6 or 7 is where I want the game to get interesting and not be ending. Now  I understand the quickier games are over for Magic the quicker you see the same stuff/cards/decks and the more you want to make them... but wee don't have to much interest in making 20 different decks to use together (I know some products make that easy).

I guess long story short the structure of MTG makes games feel over as soon as they get going. What other games offer something longer and more like a 'battle' between two people?

The beautiful historical art in Wehrlegig games (and relatedly, the thematic medieval art in Troyes I really like too).

boardgames,My Favorite Catan House Rule,False,1,0,"Catan is a relatively simple game where the objective is to score 10 victory points by building settlements, cities, or aquiring Longest Road or Largest army bonuses.

In the base game, the ends immediately as soon as someone hits 10 victory points. This makes it possible to cheese a victory. Someone at 6 victory points can potentially get lucky with the rolls leading up to their turn, and manage to build multiple roads and play a knight, claiming longest road and largest army all in the same turn.

While many people may like this style of gameplay, I find for me and the groups I usually play with, it leads to an unsatisfying end to the game.

Hence, the **House Rule:**

It is incredibly simple, and **only changes one rule.** You may declare victory on your turn as soon as you reach 10 or more victory points as usual. However, **after you declare victory, you must maintain your lead for a full round.** Meaning, it must get all the way back to your turn, and you must still have the most victory points.

The other players can prevent your victory by taking ""Largest Army"" or ""Longest Road"" from the lead player, or by exceeding them in points. (i.e. getting to 11 victory points when they only have 10) In the event of a tie in victory points, the player who declared first still wins when it gets back to their turn. Another player can only win if they get you below 10 victory points, or they **exceed** you in victory points. However, even if someone manages to exceed you in victory points, they must also maintain that lead until it gets to their turn again.

It creates a really fun end-game dynamic where all the players cooperate frantically to try and take down the top player, and also creates the interesting scenario where you must decide whether to reveal your hidden victory point development card now, or wait until you have a more secure position.

I quite enjoy playing this way, but, like any house rule, it will not be everyone's cup of tea. I'd love to hear other people's thoughts on this. Is it something you'd consider trying?",,22,,1,,public

boardgames,"Familiar Tales - clarification needed on Era 2, Chapter 6, Scenario 1",False,3,0,"I marked this post as a Spoiler so I won't be adding spoiler tags to individual bits of information in the post itself, so if you clicked to reveal this post out of curiosity but don't want anything actually spoiled for your Familiar Tales campaign, turn back now.

The scenario is titled Pengrauss' House and the story trigger that I need a clarification on is 602. The familiars grab the tome that Pengrauss had hidden away from Lord Perish. In the narration it explains the book is crazy heavy and Blaze says the group will have to travel light. It then has this bit of text...

&gt;Each familiar can only bring one item card in their pack. A familiar's starting item card does not count towards this limit.

If I'm reading this correctly the game wants us to trash EVERY item we've crafted so far or have gained from story moments (both equipped and in our Stashes) expect for 1 item each + starting cards?!?!

That's such a massive loss out of nowhere that I had to ask a second opinion on if this is actually what it is telling us to do or if I'm just misunderstanding something. We've been doing good making sure that we forage everything whenever possible so we've managed to craft *everything* in the item deck expect for like one weapon from Era 1 that we didn't really want anyway. Throwing that all away would be totally brutal.

Please no specifics spoilers for the story following where I am in the game but if there's some explanation like ""don't worry, you'll get a bunch of great stuff early in Era 3 to make up for it"" that would be both reassuring and not what I'd consider a spoiler. Thank you

boardgames,Discussion on writing in board games.,False,8,0,"I don't mean rulebook writing but all the other writing;  what you read in game intros, flavor text, text based games, books published related to a game, apps, and so forth.

What writing had been memorable to you?

**Galaxy Trucker** is probably the one that sticks out most, especially because the flavor text in the rulebook helps reinforce the rules, which you may have used when explaining the game to newcomers.

Mixing flavor text with the gameplay; somewhere out there Ben Croshaw is cracking a smile.

Shout out to the Rocky Road novel as well!  The whole truck driver scam chapter felt like a lost Douglas Adams notebook.

**Mice and Mystics** was rather enjoyable.   Especially the chapter midway in the book where all heck breaks loose and every game mechanic dumps into the same battleground!    I can still picture what was happening in my head.

Sadly, that is all that stands out to me.

---

Is it me or does good writing in board games feel lacking?   Of course this opinion is coming from me, someone who has no experience with writing and ""more of a math guy"".

FFG in particular all feels, well, bland. 

I skip the flavor text on Arkham games after 10 years of seeing them.   Descent 1st and 2nd edition felt like fantasy templates to copy and paste.

The Hour of the Huntress, one of many in the Asmodee library of stories, just didn't interest me enough to read any of the other board game novels like Arkham, or the Terraforming Mars novel.  Has anyone read that book?

Oh and the apps.   Destinies gets some points for some silly things like arm wrestling the king of Bavaria but all these app games are like ""you need to find a mushroom.  You fail to find the mushroom.  There is a door instead, the door has a sturdy lock and you can't just hit it with your axe you started the game with.  That would be rude"".

Now of course what players themselves come up with will be far more entertaining amongst themselves.   How many of you picture Jenny Barnes as a Duel weilding John Woo badass who don't take no sass?  Who imagines the jock from Betrayal at House on the Hill whose battle cry is shouting FOOTBALL before punching a monster right in the face?

Maybe that is the goal?  Less effort on flavor, more effort on a blank slate for the player to fill?

Video games today however are a joy to read, with indie titles like Outrr Wilds, Disco Elysium,  or anything by Greg Casavan to name a few.  Could quality like this be transferred to board games?

This insight won’t cover changes between the first edition of the game to this one, it will simply show some of how the design of the new edition changed over time.

# The Board

There are several things that evolved on the board. I think there were maybe 3 main versions of the board overall, with minor adjustments being made or even flipping back and forth within each version. The original board design at launch of the Kickstarter ([https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/361/619/a1771c0e3bc94fa5fef51db4957c1cd3\_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1619973354&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d06cb91e31fb3cd2c25a482b22a1f099](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/361/619/a1771c0e3bc94fa5fef51db4957c1cd3_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1619973354&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d06cb91e31fb3cd2c25a482b22a1f099)) looks quite similar to the final design today. The ribbon layout, VP track, and India map are all basically the same as the final printing.

You’ll notice the game turn track is on the top right and next to that was how the policy wheel was handled for laws. There was a token that would move around that board similarly to how the PM wheel works now, and then there were chits that would slide down the center as a means of showing the Power Value of things such as Luxuries and Shipyards. The number of chits for an item represented how much they were worth (start of game Luxuries were 2 and Shipyards were 1, but if a policy caused another chit to get slotted in the Luxury chit below would get pushed out).

The 2nd iteration (snagged from Cole’s playtesting via Discord: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/813093035767234570/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/813093035767234570/unknown.png)) brought us closer to the final design, moving the prizes to the left side of the board, and moving the Army boxes vertically down the center. The biggest change here though is the Court of Directors has shifted up (and also worked a bit differently).

The final design ([https://boardgamegeek.com/image/7033488/john-company-second-edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/7033488/john-company-second-edition)) moved the policy wheel off the board to a separate game piece, put the court of directors back to basically where it was, placed the game turn track at the start of the ribbon, added a pensioners box, a votes tracker on the right side, and many minor adjustments (and gorgeous art).

# The Game Flow

Promise cubes made their way over from the first edition of the game, and even had end game VP implications ([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/793875394415034427/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/793875394415034427/unknown.png)) These cubes were eventually removed altogether and little systems were added to replace them such as simply getting consent from players verbally to allow nepotism hiring, and adding Promise cards as additional means of bargaining.

Where the game currently uses an Opportunity Marker to allow for momentum buildup with Family Actions, the original action economy was based around a family’s children being used to get things done. Players would receive a child (family token) and be able to use that to thematically send their child off to work at the shipyards or workshops (to gain the enterprise card), send them off as a writer, or enlist as an officer. Initially, based on player count, you would receive 1 or 2 children in a round, with rounds alternating. You might start round 1 with a single child to take a single action, and then round 2 have double the action economy which could be split between different things if desired. There was even a promise card, “Child as a ward”, where someone could cash in to gain your precious child for their own action. This was a fun system as it felt restrictive, made the “Child as a ward” promise incredibly intriguing, and allowed you to diversify your actions when you had more than one child. This is a system that many earlier play testers miss, myself included, but the loss of action flexibility is replaced with each player making more difficult decisions for their actions, deciding if they want to stay the course to gain the benefit of an action twice, and potentially opens up negotiations with others as my ability to buy 2 shipyards this turn means maybe I’ll buy the second one for you if you can make it worth my while.

The secondary income known as Power was originally called Prestige and was earned in similar ways through Prestige cards (and if you were a Commander when the game ended). Power for Trophies and Laws Passed were added later. The concept of VP for those with the most Prestige was still a thing ([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png)) as well as converting assets. Prestige VP eventually changed to a flat +4/+2/-3 VP whereas those with most and second most Prestige got 4/2 VP and whoever had the least lost VP. Sucks to suck. Later on the idea of the VP gain being varied based on what turn the game ended was added.

There was a point if the company was successful, you would have a Final Retirement phase which required rolling for attrition, retiring these pieces, THEN paying the overall upkeep of your prizes. Now you don’t have to pay upkeep for these final retirements (phew). I can’t remember if upkeep was required even in the case of company failure back then, but it certainly isn’t now (which has absolutely put me in situations where I needed the company to fail else my precious old people would get kicked to the curb!) Also the cost and VP gain for prizes were adjusted once, maybe twice, with the larger prizes ultimately getting boosted for both if I recall correctly.

**Other misc items:**

There was also a point where the game could have a “Courtesy End”, forcing company failure if every share in the Court of Directors consented. Wacky!

Things went back and forth on bonus writers via the 4+ vacancies rule. This was something added due to circumstances (especially with lower player counts) where there weren’t enough writers and too many offices to fill and thus offices were just never hired. At one point the rule was you treated the Enlist Writer action as if your opportunity marker was already on it (meaning if you hadn’t taken Enlist Writer last turn you could take it this turn for 2 writers) to what it is now which is just a +1 meaning those with opportunity can gain 3 writers for this action (making it a massive 4 if Tenure Limits is in play). Haven’t seen many issues with offices not getting hired after that change!

I recall tweaks were made to the way Company Standing and Debt were handled, and what effected these items. Rebellions used to cause Standing to go down, then didn’t, then did again! But now it’s simply if a region is lost. The debt track disappeared altogether at one point and was handled by company standing track.

The timing for when Shares entered the Court of Directors changed back and forth a few times. It used to be during the Hiring phase, and then there was debate whether it was okay to have shares enter before the Firms phase, and now it’s been simply added to the end of Family Actions with the clarification that new shares can’t be invested into firms. Easy.

Company Failure cards were a crazy “last minute” addition. This was near the end of development as we were fighting over how Governors should work, and Cole thought that there needed to be a balance to make players working actively against the company have some fear of repercussions. This also replaced the “end game noise” that was lost from the removal of Hidden Interest cards. They’re one of the wilder ideas in the game, but they add a dramatic flourish!

# The Prestige Cards

Prestige cards were very different from the split between enterprise, spouses, and blackmail cards we have today. There were doubles of each card in a deck of 40. Then these were replaced by a deck of 48 cards with 6 copies of 8 suits which had different power and ways of scoring. A the end of the game you score each suit of prestige cards you have in hand and play area. The powers and scoring method were designed to encourage negotiation and reward specialization. I may have joined a bit later (and my memory is fuzzy) so for those who remember the older cards and how London Season was handled please chime in! Checking my notes I see mentioned of prestige card adjustments that made marriage worth 2x prestige, 3 Bishops being worth 6 and having a vote and inheritance, alterations to the number of prestige cards based on scenario setup.

Eventually we got to the simpler system of 3 cards in the display, and whoever spends the most for retirement gets first dibs. Blackmail cards were initially Secrets, with hidden scoring conditions for the end game (like have the most promise cards from other players). In retrospect I do miss this element quite a bit. Eventually Blackmail cards came to be with sneaky actions people could take, and power values were added to them. There were even some that still had “Hidden Interests” which were goals to achieve that gave you 3 power at end of game (like have most shipyards). The power used to be viable only if the card was played, then it was decided that having the card period was good enough to keep the power value.

Spouses were eventually changed from being worth power to being worth straight VP with an offset of some kind of limitation for the game. One last addition to spouses (which I contributed but Cole and I may have just been on the same page during that discussion) was to give Spouses a discount on retirements. There were a few ideas thrown around for some kind of retirement benefit with spouses, and the discount won out. I have made incredible VP gains from having a few spouses with discounts that really add up!

# The Enterprises

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792756081054580746/794269874293178430/unknown.png)

While ultimately small changes overall, Enterprises kind of went through a wild ride. At the start Shipyards cost £3, Luxuries were £6, and Workshops were variable depending on the Company’s balance. If the company made less money in a round Workshops would be cheaper, but if the Company made more money Workshops would be less (and you may have to pay upkeep on them). This was a great system that I didn’t get a chance to play with too much before it was removed entirely for a fixed cost of £4.

Now workshops are £5, worth 2 votes, a passive income of £1, and will earn you a VP if the company fails. As seen above they used to be worth passive income of £2 and didn’t get you a VP. If you invested a Workshop you lost your votes, but this was eventually altered.

What feels pretty late in the design process there was a sudden decision to drastically reduce the cost of Shipyards and Luxuries. While it may not seem like a price cut of £1 is all that much for Shipyards, let me tell you it alters the dynamics of the game a LOT. Suddenly it’s easy to want to snag another shipyard, and they can be financially lucrative now as they recoup their costs quicker. This was one of the more exciting changes that occurred, and made us raise our eyebrows and go, “oh wow, that’s nuts”.

And let’s talk about Luxuries getting slash from £6 to £5 to eventually £4! That’s a massive discount for 2 VP and makes Luxuries something that players will actually go for. Before this change these were things rarely sought after, except maybe a late game boost. Now they’re a reasonable grab, especially for players who either just have extra coin to spend or who need to make up for lack of retirements. You’ll notice that these now are subject to a Window tax (as are the prizes) which was another concept added much later in the design to penalize more successful players.

# The Offices

**The Chairman**

\- Used to start with a Prestige card off the top of the deck.

\- Court of Directors had a fixed maximum of 6 shares, and a specific way of handling the vote for the new Chairman which totally eludes me at this point so if someone remembers chime in. Eventually the court size was eliminated, and elections were simplified to a majority vote for someone.

\- The Chairman used to not count as a Share, but now does. Also, the way they handled debt has been altered. Now the Chairman can take a whopping 3 debt without any permission, before they needed consent from the court, or at one point needed at least half of the court’s approval. Chairman also had a Special Envoy action that allowed them to peak at cards and remove all chaos (now what would simply be a closed order) from a region.

**Director of Trade**

\- Used to be allowed 3 transfers.

\- Special Envoy from Chairman office was moved to DOT with their treasury being spent on dice for the check. This treasury had a max of £5 then £6 but eventually the limit was removed.

**Manger of Shipping**

\- Used to have to fit player ships first, but then was given allowance to fit Extra ships instead of desired. This certainly made a big change in how this office operates, as now Shipping has some leverage to negotiate with other players versus simply going through the motions of the job. “I’ll fit your ship for a pound” should be etched into the side of the box.

\- Extra ships were an interesting addition as well, allowing for more flexibility for larger trades even if players hadn’t invested in enough shipyards. I can’t remember if Company Ships were always indestructible, but I believe they were. Player ships didn’t always have the ability to flip on fatigue though.

\- Shipping could also their own shipyards if there were no player ships to fit, but these shipyards were replaced by Company Ships to make things easier.

**Military Affairs**

\- I’m not sure much if anything changed here. If I’m wrong let me know!

**Commanders**

\- Commanders used to get exhausted like any other office, but were changed to only get eliminated on catastrophic failure (and eventually changed based on majority of officers.

\- Commanders used to have 2 actions, which basically got rolled into the singular Deploy action later in development. Commanders could either quell unrest in an EIC controlled region (remove unrest and open orders) or they could invade. Now the singular Deploy action does one or both of these things depending on the targeted region, making things a bit simpler. Regiments used to get death checks as well, in the case of failed invasions or lost offices. Eventually Regiments were made to become Terminators that couldn’t be killed, and the death checks were altered in several ways.

\- Death checks used to be a standard check, then became something that happened if a skull was rolled during a Commanders action, then were changed to being required for all officers used during any Commander action but only being eliminated on 6s. There was a lot of tweaking the death check system and way the armies worked. Regiments now being permanent fixtures means the company needs to be careful about adding more, as they (like company ships) are going to be an increasing expense that will likely never go away (unless we were to go to War with France perhaps).

\- A new loot system was put in place where the player with the most officers took half rounded down, then the next most took what remained, with anything left going to the presidency. Then the system was just rolling a die after successful invasion and getting the amount rolled, split between folks. I believe actually that the die with the skull had a few different loot values on it and so you’d invade, if successful roll the loot die, and then get to split the loot amount or people died if the skull was rolled.

\- Regiments were changed to not get loot and not cost upkeep, then eventually changed to being part of the loot split and being an expense.

\- Having a Commander at the end of the game used to gain you 1 power, and then this was removed entirely. Eventually power was added back by Commanders gaining trophies for successful invasions or defense against attacks. Region loss caused a Commander to lose all of their trophies, but eventually was changed to half rounded up.

**Presidents**

\- The Presidency used to have a strict order of Commanders, President, Governors. Eventually this was swapped so that Governors acted first, then Commanders, then President. Fairly late in the development Cole realized that it didn’t matter with the way each of these offices had been tweaked and the President could just be given the opportunity to choose the order (and often times there are much more optimal orders depending on the board state such as Governors going first to give Commanders regiments to open up closed orders for the President to trade, or President guaranteeing a trade first and then deciding to give remaining money to Commander for local alliance, etc etc)

\- Used to only be able to trade X orders where X was the lower between number of ships and writers. Eventually Writers were no longer a bandwidth limitation and the generic writer was introduced (which has now just become the Filled Order token). Writers also didn’t always get a bonus for being used (but we love that they do now don’t we!)

**Governors**

\- Went through a LOT of changes, especially during a specific few weeks near the end of development where both Governors and Governor General went back and forth through different iterations until Cole finally decided on something he was happy with. Some folks miss Governor version 3.0 whereas we settled on 5.0 or whatnot, but where things landed is likely the most streamlined and easier to utilize.

\- This office used to have their own treasuries, get Bonuses during Bonus phase, and could invade. They would due things like tax but decide if they wanted to keep a buck for themselves, request money from the president, commission regiments, quell chaos, and build permanent forts which increased defense or build infrastructure which increased value of orders.

\- Eventually Governors no longer needed money for checks and had a dice value based on the region (indicated on the Gov card) +1 if all orders were open in that region.

**Superintendent of Trade in China**

\- Used to act after Bonus phase. Used to get opened and then had to be filled next turn during hiring, and worked like any Presidency in that it required ships and a treasury to spend for checks. Eventually China was given a jumpstart in that the office was immediately hired upon creation and was given £5 and 2 Extra ships so it could trade that turn. This was ultimately simplified so that it used the number of ships for the check, thus not requiring a treasury.

\- The India board used to have Plantations that would dictate how much money China would make for trading. Each plantation was £4 per plantation. Eventually plantations were swapped out for built Opium Icons on the board. As long as EIC controlled that region those icons counted towards the China trade.

\- The saddest change to this office, which affected the board as well, is the Opium Icon was switched out for an Exported Goods icon. Thematically the opium trade was getting going at this time and the China office is EIC getting that ball rolling with their plantations. Because the game is produced in China, and because China is super sensitive about opium (for obvious reasons) Cole was advised he needed to change the icon as a poppy would cause problems. The opium trading had to be dumbed down to generic exports.

**Governor General**

\- This position went through many tweaks as well, which I don’t really recall entirely. As with the Governors, GG went through a dramatic season of changes until Cole was satisfied. The dice pool that the Governor General utilized was something that eventually made its way over to the Governors.

**Commander-In-Chief**

\- This position used to exist! It was like the Governor General, and even had it’s own law card to create the position. This removed all commanders, replaced Military Affairs, and Commander-In-Chief was now the sole controller of all things related to the army.

**Prime Minister**

\- Prime Minister used to be attainable by simply being the one who had the most votes for a law passing. Eventually the Leader of the Opposition was added, requiring someone to have the most votes against a law that ultimately fails to snipe the PM. Again, something that seems to have been a bit earlier than my experience, but it seems laws were something divvied out to players and the PM could pick in their hand or another consenting player’s hand. There also didn’t used to be pass/fail conditions on laws, but I’m not as familiar with what this looked like (I assume fairly like how laws might have been in first edition, again those who know please chime in!). PM was also not worth Power initially but is now worth 2, good enough reason to try and steal the position in the end game yeah? Though, pro tip, consider that PM position is the ultimate tie breaker for things such as Prestige Card choice and even end game…so either having the position or helping someone closer to your right have the position can be very important.

# The India Map

\- Plantations existed in specific regions and provided the value for China’s trade. Eventually Plantations covered open orders and increased these orders by £5.

\- Order values across the map were tweaked. Some were lowered, others raised (Hyderabad went from £6 to **7).**

\- The number of open orders had a penalty of region strength including empires like when invading.

\- There were specific differences between a rebellion occurring in an EIC controlled region and an invasion from another region coming into our territory. Invasions had to manage the strength of the region/empire, where rebellions were solely the unrest. Eventually a rebellion in one EIC region caused unrest in all the regions. Then unrest was added to the total strength of an invasion as well as being strength for rebellion. Now if the company gets invaded it’s chaos everywhere on the map. There was a lot of small adjustments with how the unrest cubes worked, what they counted towards, and how different crisis events were handled. Some were more difficult to keep straight than others, but things should be considerably more clear now with how there’s basically 3 defined events now (Rebellion, Invasion, or Attack against the Company).

\- The loot system changed many times over for commanders, and the amount of money looted also was altered by changes to the Governor tokens and then adding £4 per tower level to incentivize a greedy invasion against a stronger region.

\- Cascades would simply be ignored or only go so far if they couldn’t be actioned, but Cole decided that cascades should cause cascades and now we’re all aware of how important it is to keep specific orders open as often as possible to avoid horrible things.

\- The Elephant used to move around based solely off the Event deck, but Cole noticed that India wasn’t behaving as dynamically as desired (or as he stated, “India was self-cannibalizing a little too dramatically and I was finding situations with 2 empires (let alone 3) to basically never be happening)…” and thus few changes were made. A - regions used to be capable of Collapse, which would occur if a region needed to remove a tower level but didn’t have one. This caused all orders in the region to close and may have had other implications that I can’t recall. B – Tower level decreased on failed rebellion/invasion instead of whoever was the loser between the crisis. C – Imperial Ambitions was born to provide moment to a successful Invader so they’d move to take over another region instead of the Elephant moving off elsewhere.

\- Obviously there were a number of other changes made to the Event deck itself, balancing out the frequency and types of events, how the Elephant would be directed, and other minute details that Cole would probably need to key you in on to appreciate.

# The Firms

\- Unfortunately, I didn’t jump into the firm game until later on, though I did get to experience one or two large changes to how things were being handled.

\- Deregulation rules changed multiple times, with deregulation being mandatory when the company hit specific spaces on standing or debt (see the green spaces in the older boards).

\- A debtors prison was a fun idea suggested by someone that was added later on, and how/when people could invest in firms shifted around a bit. You used to have to trade company shares 2:1 for firm shares if standing/debt were on what are now striped spaces.

\- Firms used to provide power but eventually were changed to VP based on company value and shares. Before it was anyone who had a share in a firm received the power it was worth I believe. Craziness.

\- The way shares and ships worked in firms went through some adjusting. There wasn’t always a cap on shares if I remember right, and the +1 to ships was added later on to allow for smaller firms a better chance at success. The best change was the way initiative was added with ships minus successes being an indicator on who gets to roll first. This allows smaller firms a chance at success with larger firms existing, as more ships means chances are you might be trading later for half value. These things really evened out the firm game and allowed much more flexibility and viability for different types of firms to exist and function.

\- I suggest anyone who really got to dive into the firm games as it developed chime in and provide insight as I only have so much!

# The Crown

The solo game didn’t change too much over the course of things, as you can see from this preview ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c9NJ-DRI2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c9NJ-DRI2o)). Many changes were due to Ricky needing to keep up with development tweaks to all the many elements of the core game. Overall, the way The Crown runs and behaves stayed the same, with the brilliant Promise Cube system being used as a way to gain leverage and negotiate with the AI. There were changes to promise cube values of course, how much is needed to spend to get The Crown to behave this way, or how much do I gain from doing The Crown this favor. There were also plenty of opportunities to edit or add additional ways for players to interact with her.

Some things were added over the course of testing to ensure things remained balanced and challenging. Little annoyances like players as Chairman needing to give up a cube each round or being forced to give cubes if opening a firm. At one point there were variable VP gained based on how many cubes you had at end of game, but eventually this was done away with. The -VP penalty for company failure was added as a great way to ensure you are working hard to keep the company afloat or have ensured your position can take the hit from company failure cards and the like. The climate of the Crown changed a bit, with things like “anchor” and “bell” being changed to “Fox” and Stag” or however it shook out. The personalities behind these climates remained intact from what I can tell.

Originally The Crown would do everything in her power to gain and keep the Prime Minister position, not caring at all about the laws and simply acting in a way that would obtain or retain PM. Eventually Ricky got fancy and was able to create a dynamic system for The Crown to care about each law depending on climate and circumstance. She would also spend money and votes towards her cause, which was then tweaked to the variable bonus votes based on treasury.

The original Crown Handbook was over 60 pages, basically dedicating an entire section to each climate. You would have a section that was for Bull and it would go from Chairman to China and then the next section would do the same. This was a nice layout, but it was frustrating to jump between the sections based on climate (despite it only changing once per turn) and didn’t allow players to see at a glance what the dynamics were between climates. I will take full credit here and say I spent far too long putting together an alternate handbook with intention to share to BGG that ultimately became the current Crown Handbook. The handbook format/layout as you see it today was what I compiled, copied over by Drew and prettied up and edited as necessary for the final print. I’m incredibly pleased to see that something I had worked hard to make as a benefit to players ended up becoming the official format for how folks will play the game.

One last thing I can think of is the Crown Climate shift itself. I had brought up how it was somewhat frustrating that I could, as Chairman for example, know everything The Crown was intending to do for the round as I figured out treasuries and such. I would know her behavior and desire to act this way or that. I could ensure I didn’t give too much to a Presidency that would fail to act or give her the opportunity to squander cash for something harmful. Ricky had stated he was playing with an idea to give the Crown a little bit more unpredictability. Other than at the start of the game, the only other time you would draw a new AI card was during Parliament Phase to get a new climate and see how The Crown would vote. An additional Climate change was added to the Chairman phase, and cleverly to the beginning if Crown or after if player. This meant that I as Chairman would have to go through the motion of planning the round without knowing exactly what climate I was getting. Great! However, Ricky wanted something a bit more dynamic in the climate shifting and thus the Shift Climate section in the Parliament Phase was made. Ricky went through different iterations on how exactly this played out, but he ultimately settled on what we have now which allows for dynamics based on the company’s standing. This element alone took a bit of work to get down right, mostly to ensure players would perform it properly (I might be the reason the rules clarify “failure + catastrophic failure” when simply saying failure should be enough…).

# The End

This was pieced together from scouring the announcements channel in the Discord and from my own memory and experiences playing the game over the past year and a half. As I said, there are far more experienced players who have spent so many more hours playing this game who can likely provide some great insight (and possibly a few corrections to my info above).

I was lucky to have a friend group who took to this game and allowed us to play dozens of games as testers, and I was fortunate to get to work somewhat closely with Ricky as I focused more of my plays on the solo game with a handful of other awesome people. I’m incredibly excited to see what comes next for Wehrlegig and Ricky, and am looking forward to testing and helping out in anyway I can to make these projects the best they can be.

I encourage those who were along for this journey share your experiences. I’m also happy to answer any other questions the best I can.

boardgames,Finding the name of a certain alien themed game,False,8,0,"I need help finding the name of a board game with alien theme that I played one night with a random group of people a few years ago. I'm sorry if there are details that I remember wrong. 

\- The game was about a crew crashing their spaceship on an alien planet. The crew try to find ways to get out of that planet, while aliens there try to ""assimilate"" them.

\- 5 or 6 players, with one player taking the ""alien"" side, the rest taking the ""crew"" side

\- 5-7 ""locations"". Each player must pick a location each turn, and if the ""alien"" player chooses the same one as at least one of the ""crew"" players, some sort of ""meter"" goes down (or up, when it reaches max the alien player wins IIRC.)

\- There were some special abilities/tasks/benefits that were unique to each location. IIRC the alien also had some special abilities.

\- The game lasts for a few rounds. If the crew side manages to finish their objectives at the locations, they win; otherwise, the alien wins if time runs out or they manage to catch enough crew members enough times.

\- The crew players can discuss among themselves strategies and locations, but any discussion must be made in the presence of the alien player.",,5,,8,,public

The maneuver cards seems to be faction specific lets say you draw a Elb/Dwarf maneuver card as the shadow what then? Should the maneuver cards and special cards be spilt so that each player only can pulls there maneuver cards or is it intended that you can draw the wrong faction maneuver card… as say a dead card but atleast you opponent can’t use it?

boardgames,WSBG Vegas 2022 Review or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Fact that Nobody Knows WTF is Going On,False,229,0,"a short (?), sweet (??), and scathing (!!!) review of my experience in Vegas...

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday: there are two Ring Events this night, 7 Wonders and Splendor; so far, so good, everything seems fairly well-conducted. I check in at the desk at the front of the Tournament Hall and I am given my table and my seat number, all is well and the night proceeds...

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday: my Ring Event this day is Wingspan, 9a start time - I check in at the front desk and I am given my table and my seat number. The ""player board"" tournament template that was introduced by the WSBG organizers started to be exercised, and it gave me some measure of confidence in their interest in conducting a fair and structured event. However, I noted at this time that there was no common game clock: games started when they were ready, and neither judges nor tournament procedures were ever introduced. When we needed assistance it was necessary for somebody from our table to get up and seek out somebody that looked like they might be a ""judge"" (???). Surprisingly, during our first game we were told by somebody who looked like a judge that we had \*\* 4 hours \*\* to complete the first round -&gt; this loose time control will come in to play again later in this review...

&amp;#x200B;

Friday (the cracks begin to show): As I did for the previous two events, I went to the front desk to check in. Somebody who ""looked like a judge"" (recall nobody has ever been formally introduced, they can only be recognized by standing in the right place at the right time wearing what looks like the right shirt) told me to ""go to the back corner of the hall"" for my game. I did so, and then somebody else wearing the right shirt asked me ""did you check in?"" -&gt; to which of course I responded ""no, I was told to come over here"". He then told me to go back to the front desk and check in... so back to the front desk I went, where I was admonished, yelled at and asked ""who told you to come up here? go back to the corner!"" -&gt; ???. I return to the back corner of the hall, somebody new wearing the right shirt shows up and tells everybody to find their name and seat number on a placard on one of the 7 tables and prepare for their game. After everybody finds their seat there are over a dozen players still milling about, confused that they have not been seated. The tournament organizer (?) that I previously mentioned starts reading names, covering all of the players who have not yet been seated, and tells them to step aside and be seated at another group of tables. Then, we are instructed to begin our round when we are ready. It seems like a rather small field, and then we come to find out: of the \~40 players that signed up for the event, for some reason \*\* 13 \*\* players were given a first round bye!! What was supposed to be a 4 round Ring Event (where the winner advances to Sunday's semifinals) was now at best a 3 round event where 1/3 of the field was given a first round bye...

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday, the final day of Ring Events: Dune Imperium

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;&lt; the degraded experience as the days went by prepared me for the s#!t show that was to come, and I was not disappointed &gt;&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Dune: Imperium -&gt; a sold out event (1 of maybe 2?) and arguably the crown jewel of the tournament given the game's popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

The first round was scheduled to start at 3p (already rescheduled twice) and when I arrived to check in I found the doors to the tournament hall closed. I opened the door and walked to the check-in desk.

&amp;#x200B;

“What game are you here for?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Dune”

&amp;#x200B;

“Game start has been delayed, please wait outside the hall and we’ll call you in when we’re ready for you”

&amp;#x200B;

...a sign on the door would have been helpful, but instead they had to make this same statement to at least 30 other people that opened the doors and went inside over the next 45 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

\~45 minutes later somebody wearing what looks like the right shirt comes out and instructs us to start lining up for check-in, again this game is sold out so we’ve got 256 players to get seated at 64 tables.

&amp;#x200B;

Check-in is complete, everybody is seated, but nobody has come around to instruct us how to proceed. After a few more minutes my table decides to reach out to the table next to us and swap game copies with them so we can start getting set up (recall: everybody had to bring their own copy of the game for the Ring Events that they signed up for, and you couldn’t play with your own copy so swapping like this is how it usually went; also note that fewer than half of the players at my tables actually brought copies of the game, so who exactly were these instructions for??).

&amp;#x200B;

My table is all set up, we're chatting, I have a good group of players and I’m feeling like this is going to be an enjoyable session... some more time passes and it looks like literally nobody is in control, besides being given table and seat numbers at check-in we have not received any instruction, so I get up to go find somebody who looks like they are wearing the right shirt to ask when we are starting the round and was told “oh, if you’re ready start now” grrrrr... so we did.

&amp;#x200B;

As the first round of the game starts we are all being very deliberate and taking our time, making sure that we all understand the ""player board"" template rules and deciding upon the conventions we want to establish for ""pieces played / cards laid"" etc. -- During this round a player at our table brings up a rules question and offers what they think the answer is; I agree and I am ready to continue the game, esp. as the question has nothing to do with anything currently happening on the board and was more “what if” based, but 2 other players didn’t agree with the interpretation and wanted a judge ruling at that moment. So our table calls for a judge, one comes over and discusses the rules and chats about where to find a valid ruling as they search through print-outs (rule book vs. published errata vs. BGG Dennen posts etc.) and just generally wastes time that didn’t need to be used at the moment, but whatever... 25 minutes or so go by and we get back to the game and we finish the first round of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

We start the second round of the game and another rules question comes up re: “are discard piles open information?”. I answer “yes of course they are”, a player at our table disagrees and wants a ruling, and this one I’m happy to get officially resolved since it should be quick \*\*and\*\* I know I’m right \*\*and\*\* I intend on using this during the game. A judge comes over and tells us “no, discard piles are not open information” ?!!?. I ask for them to bring another judge over, and after some rule book and errata investigation (along with more unnecessary casual chatting) the second judge decided to rule that “you can look through your own discard pile but not your opponent’s”, arghhhhhh !!!! To which I replied “if that is the ruling that you’re going to hold us to you are going to have a room full of very upset players, because every other player here knows that discard piles are absolutely open information” - but that was that, the ruling was made and we continued our game (another 20+ minutes spent on this unsatisfactorily resolved matter).

&amp;#x200B;

\^ not 10 minutes later I overhear the same question come up at a table in the next row, somebody who looks like a judge appears and immediately rules for that table that “yes, discard piles are open information”... so I guess there’s just different rules at each table ??

&amp;#x200B;

My table begins the third round of the game (for those unfamiliar, this game usually runs 8-9 rounds of play), we are finally looking like all of the B.S. might be behind us and we can get on with playing the game - halfway through the round one of the judges (the same from our first “rules question”) comes over to say “you have less than 40 minutes to finish your game” —— WAT

&amp;#x200B;

“the round ends @ 5:30”

&amp;#x200B;

How can that be, I ask? The round started late, and in fact every table started at different times since nobody told us when to start or what the time controls would be (recall we had 4 HOURS for our 1st round of Wingspan, so it never crossed my mind that time would be an issue here) - in addition, at least 45 minutes of our game time thus far had been wasted by judges who didn’t know what they were doing and seemingly had no problem taking their time and chatting us up using our game time !!

&amp;#x200B;

But that was it, the game ends at 5:30, finish it up - so then everybody at the table tilts, players at my table start yelling at each other, everybody rushing for whatever scraps of points they can get before time runs out, misplays abound (myself included), it becomes a giant clusterF..

&amp;#x200B;

My table is at the beginning of round 7 of the game when the same judge comes by again to tell us “game ends in 10 minutes, at that time finish the round and declare a winner” - at least that’s what I heard, 2 other players at our table heard “game ends in 10 minutes, finish THIS round and declare a winner” which makes considerably less sense, why bother telling us how much time is left if we’re just supposed to finish the current round? So this needed another judge ruling / clarification (and this one was actually necessary, since this absolutely impacts play for the next set of turns) - a few more minutes are wasted, the judge that comes over can’t give us a decisive answer (??) so says “I will go get an answer for you, I’ll be right back” — which doesn’t really help...

&amp;#x200B;

Half of the players at our table want to continue the game in the meantime, certain that this was indeed the last round and playing for the points to make sure they can secure the lead until the end of the round; myself and another player believe we can finish this round and get to the next one before time is called, and of course we both want that ruling as it puts us in the position we want to be in... but in truth nobody knows for sure what is going on at this point, everything is FUBAR

&amp;#x200B;

The round ends, everybody has exhausted their resources / screwed up their plays / tried to position themselves to reach a win condition at the time that they \_believed\_ the game would end.

&amp;#x200B;

The judge comes back and says “don’t worry about the time, just finish the game to completion”.

&amp;#x200B;

...and all hell breaks loose, my table is about to be flipped, \_nobody\_ is happy about this, none of us have reserved the resources or the play options to successfully plan to play this out.

&amp;#x200B;

Each player in our game was convinced they would have won in a different round given a different ruling on when the game was supposed to end...

&amp;#x200B;

Time to breathe, reliving this as I typed it out was fairly traumatic... there is no world in which I would ever do this again with these rank amateurs, this event was so poorly conducted, I feel incredibly duped; they were in no way prepared to succeed at a venture at this scale, despite marketing themselves as if they were; the resources exist in the gaming community that would have made them successful, I do not understand why they did not take advantage of them.

I didn't really have anything like it so I said why not; And since then I've played a half dozen times. 
Nobody ever wants to play just once. It's wild and chaotic, and always gets people talking (often shouting). starting out it seems pretty dull and slow, but As soon as bets starts hitting the table the excitement builds and everyone gets into it.

You don't bet money like other games, instead you bet with tokens that will multiple your payout based on how well a horse scores. There's also exotic finishes, prop bets, and side VIP cards for even more options. These other options can kind of be a lot to add for new players, so there is an option to leave those out.

The horses are controlled by one player being the ""house"" and rolling dice to see which horse moves. It also comes with a great app that allows everyone to bet and nobody needs to play the house. It also features an excited commentator who will loudly announce the big changes in the race.

All in all it was a great experience, and so far I've played in groups as small as 2 and big as 5 with people old and young. It plays up to 8 people (9 if someone is playing the house) and I look forward to how hectic it'll be with a full complement of players",,6,,13,,public

boardgames,WILDTAILS (Legacy Tails of Baritaria) Review - Buttonshy Legacy Card Game!!,False,2,0,"(Full video review here: https://youtu.be/h4y_3FkUXh8)

Ahoy there folks! For this week's video, I thought I'd break the trend with something a little more unscripted, a little more what's happening now. As such I'm going to be talking to you all about WILDTAILS - A Pirate Legacy; a pirate themed legacy resource management game for 1-2 players from Buttonshy games.

First of all, let me introduce you to Buttonshy games, if you don't already know about them. These guys make fantastic games using only eighteen cards, that come in these dinky little wallets, much like the ones you'd use for your train pass. We already have Skulls of Sedlec and Sprawlopolis, which I'll cover in future videos.

So what makes WILDTAILS so special? Well, firstly, it's a pirate game, and if you watched my review of LOOT, you'll know how I feel about pirate games.

Secondly, it's a Legacy game. No really. It's a Legacy Game, with only eighteen cards.

For those of you who don't know, Legacy games, like Pandemic Legacy or Risk Legacy, are games that evolve and change from round to round permanently altering the game. Depending on how you do, you may permanently modify the board, add new rules or cards, or even remove and destroy cards entirely. This means your next game session is going to be different and it feels like the game is evolving around you.

But again, to be able to do this kind of experience with only eighteen cards sounded frankly ludicrous. When I first heard about it through a friend on the boardgames Subreddit, I was a little dubious. Kind of like a treasure map found in a random bottle floating by. I contacted the guys at Buttonshy, and I've been beta testing the game for a week or so now and it REALLY holds up.

The basic premise of WILDTAILS is that you're aiming to build your own pirate empire in the semi-fictional American south following a story campaign of ten chapters.

The decisions you make throughout the campaign do affect the outcome, and also modify which new rules unlock on certain cards. As the campaign progresses, you'll unlock new abilities for your pirates, enhance your empire and even unlock a fleet fairly early on. You'll also get to choose new abilities for the characters as the game progresses and, without spoiling anything, the decisions you make can, and will make certain chapters more or less difficult.

So how does it actually play?

Basic gameplay involves you attempting to complete two objectives, before driving off that scenarios Threat, which could be Raiders, or even the bloody British Navy. You do this by taking actions each turn to complete scenes, attack the threat to keep it under control, or using character abilities and honestly, the way this all works is a little ingenious.

Besides the playable characters, the Empire card, and the reference card, every card in the game is having an identity crisis and is a Scene on one side of it, and then either an Objective or a Threat on the other. These cards also have FOUR different resources around the edges.

One of the most common actions you'll do on your turn is to interact with the current Scene card, completing one of the four tasks shown on it, hiring crew, pillaging the governor's manor, or... Robbing graves???

One of these tasks is usually free. Two have costs involved to achieve them, and the fourth usually involves a skill check to complete. When you complete a task on a Scene, you find which of the four edges shows the resources rewarded, and slip it under your character.

Cool, right? I love how they've managed to get so much done with so few cards!

In future turns, these resources can be used to pay for other tasks, or for interacting with various special abilities.

To make a skill check, you first reference the relevant ability on your character sheet, then reveal the scene below the current Scene for its modifier. You add this modifier to your character ability and if it matches or exceeds the requirement, the check was successful. Huzzah, pop open the rum, you're awesome.

Special note should be made that if the two Scenes ""Curse"" symbols match, it's an automatic failure, which adds a little tension even on easier checks, which I really like, even if it has dashed some of my best laid plans against the rocks of inadequacy.

If you fail a Skill Check, the scene is discarded, if you succeed, you earn the rewards.

At the end of each of your turns, you can also store cards under your empire card for other characters to hopefully use, thanks to the Smuggle action.

The second most common action is completing objectives. To complete a scenario, you must complete both objectives fully, then chase away the Threat.

To complete an objective, you must pay resources matching it's completion criteria. The first time this happens, you'll slide the objective under your character where it now provides permanent abilities and modifiers. As you complete the objective again and again, these cards slide up giving further rewards and abilities.

Again, how cool is this? This card was a Scene, four different resources, and an Objective, now it's a tracker giving you additional stuff each turn!

You'll ultimately need to complete each objective four times to get the final ability to line up so that you can finally chase away the threat and complete the scenario.

That, in a nutshell, is the main gameplay loop, making decisions, gathering resources, and completing the two objectives before beating the Threat. But there are a number of rubs and twists to really spice things up, like a bar fight at Tortuga.

Firstly, the threats don't sit idly watching your game, waiting to be taken out. They are called THREATS, after all.

Once the Scene deck depletes the first time, you'll reshuffle the discard pile to make a new Scene deck, then the Threat will capture one of the scenes, making the Threat tougher to beat and thinning the Scene deck a little. Then the Threat advances, using the Pirate's Log reference card as a convenient marker.

Now, the Curse symbols on the scenes suddenly gain a new use. At the start of a turn, if the Scene's curse marker matches any of the Curse Markers lined up on the Pirate's Log, then the relevant Threat affect triggers. This can involve capturing more Scenes, losing resource cards and more. These effects can really throw a cutlass into the works.

The more resource cards you hold, or are captured by the Threat, the faster the rounds go and the quicker it all ramps up. The trick is to use your resources quickly and efficiently, and try to effectively manage the threat by attacking it.

If you ever run out of Scene cards, or if the Threat captures five cards, or if you reach the end of the seventh round, the game ends in a failure.

Attacking the threat is the third action you can do on your turn, and involves making a Skill Check against the threat, increasing the requirements based on the number of cards the threat has currently captured. Whether you fail or pass this skill check, the current Scene is discarded. If you do manage to succeed, however, you smack the Threat upside the face, or some other equally heroic action, and all the captured Scenes are discarded. The Threat remains, and doesn't decrease in any other way, but you have those all important Scene cards back in the game for future rounds, and the Threat is easier to beat in future.

If you've completed both your objectives and have those final symbols lined up, it now means the Threat can be permanently defeated. Succeeding now will chase the Threat away and win the game.

The way that the Threat escalates throughout the game by adding more and more troublesome curse abilities, by stealing cards out of the Scene deck to speed up rounds, and getting stronger the more it captures really adds a sense of growing tension to the game that I really wasn't expecting.

This results in some really unnerving situations where you feel like you're racing against the clock. Doing whatever you can to keep pushing your objectives, whilst juggling an ever growing Threat really ups the ante in ways I wasn't expecting, and knowing that winning or losing scenarios changes the course of the story made for a really fun experience.

Now, some cooperative games absolutely suck to lose. Whilst I'm a fan of the Dark Souls boardgame, spending half an hour to set up a game that you play for three hours then lose, feels awful, and honestly, it's a real hard sell to go again. WILDTAILS? Screw it. Resetting takes seconds, and each scenario takes around 10-15 minutes, give or take any action paralysis.

Ultimately, eventually you'll reach the end of the campaign victorious, add up your score based on how you did through the game's four Acts, and get a final score. And normally, that's where a Legacy game ends. The board has been mutilated, cards destroyed, stickers all over the shop, and that's the experience.

Not so with WILDTAILS!

Once the campaign is over, you can continue to use your upgraded cards in post campaign one-shot scenarios. This was something I wasn't expecting and are still really cool!

You play with two random objectives, and a random Threat, and this can make for some really interesting scenarios not seen in the campaign. Obviously, your characters are fully upgraded at this point, and there's no way to undo any of the decisions you made that altered the cards, but this just means your version of post-campaign WILDTAILS is going to be different to other folks.

I was worried that playing post-campaign with fully upgraded characters and randomised objectives and threats could make things really hit or miss, but whilst there are definitely easier and harder setups, none ever felt unfair, but none ever felt smooth sailing either.

And remember, this is a Buttonshy game. Most of their current games are around the $12 range, with cheaper print and play options. Honestly, I expect WILDTAILS to be slightly more expensive due to a few extra components - mainly the sticker sheets - but even then, the value is astonishing, and for something that fits in your wallet and can be played in a space less than a square foot, I wouldn't mind picking up a few copies to go through a few times with friends.

And if you're happy to print and play, well, you can just keep printing new sets.

As much as I loved going through Pandemic Legacy the first time, the price tag makes it less appealing for replays, and there's no way to really play it after the campaign concludes short of trying to peel off stickers and using Tipex to erase whatever you've written on the board. It's a large pricetag for a shared experience and whilst it's absolutely wonderful, it definitely feels more like a one and done.

WILDTAILS has that inbuilt post-campaign playability, and going through the campaign again is only a minor investment.

Now, I'm using a prototype print and play supplied by Buttonshy here, using greyscale artwork and some filler graphics. The finished product will be full colour, and printed on proper card stock as you'd expect.

But even in greyscale, the artwork is gorgeous. The Scenes are lively and detailed, and I absolutely adore the animorphic characters. Seriously, if there's anything I love more than pirates, its Saturday Morning Cartoon pirates. Being Jack Sparrow is cool, but being Jack The Sparrow is even cooler. At least to me.

Honestly, if I have any complaint against the prototype, it's that the rules can be a little confusing to get your rum addled head around at first. Understanding that cards essentially have two or three uses each is the first hurdle. It's a Scene card, unless it's being used as a Threat card or an Objective card, or maybe even a Resource Card.

But once you understand this, the game is quick to set up and play, as you'd expect from Buttonshy, and a great fun experience.

Honestly, my journey with WILDTAILS started with me dubious that a legacy game could be done with eighteen cards, let alone be fun, but Buttonshy have once again proved their game design chops and crafted something genuinely fun, unique, and astonishing.

When this one launches, to me, it'll be a no brainer to add to our crew of games. It's small, cheap, and endlessly replayable. Until then, I'll keep playing games with my prototype deck.

If you enjoy pirate themes, and tense resource management, this game could be for you. If you give it a try, let me know in the comments. Otherwise, happy sailing, and see you all next time!",,0,,2,,public

boardgames,Betrayal at House on the Hill Question: How do you use the laundry chute tile?,False,14,0,"Okay, my friends and I have the 3rd edition of Betrayal at House on the Hill. We’re in a heated debate over the laundry chute tile. It reads “Leads to the Basement Landing. If you end your turn on this tile, place your explorer on the Basement Landing.” 

One group reads it as this… The “leads to the basement landing” part implies you can use this to get to the basement anytime. If you run out of movement and end your turn on the laundry chute, you place your explorer in the basement without a choice. So if you’re exploring new tiles and you use your last movement speed to discover the laundry chute tile, since your character landed on the chute, they have to go to the basement. They fall down it essentially. 

If you have plenty of movement speed and discover the laundry chute tile, you can choose to jump down it and continue exploring the basement. You’re only forced to do it if you meet the condition of being out of movement. 

One group reads it as this… The laundry chute leads to the basement, but you can only go down it if you end your turn on that tile. So if you have 3 movement speed left, you can’t go down the laundry chute, but if you use up your movement and land on the tile, you’ll go to the basement. “If you end your turn on this tile, place your explorer on the basement landing.” The only time the condition is met and you can use the laundry chute is if you end your turn on that tile. 

Does it make more sense that you can only go down a laundry chute if you end your turn there or does it make more sense that you can go down a laundry chute anytime as a one way ticket down and if you end your turn there, since you’re out of movement speed you’re forced to fall down? 

Considering barriers, movement impairments from enemies, limited tiles leading to the basement. Which is more balanced?",,27,,14,,public

boardgames,Arkham Horror LCG -- Does it get better?,False,36,0,"Picked up the Revised Core set a few weeks ago, jumped into the core campaign with my wife. I also started a separate playthrough with my brother.

Spoilers follow!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**CAMPAIGN WITH WIFE:**
She played Daisy (cluer) and I played Roland (fighter). The first scenario went swimmingly, with our team netting 6 experience points each by the end. The second scenario was definitely a step-up in difficulty. We were only able to interrogate two cultists (almost a third) before midnight struck. We played the third scenario last night, and it was a disaster. I pulled both of Roland's weaknesses in the first few rounds, and then all of the leftover cultists showed up. The end boss arrived, and we had little chance of winning. I had Lita in my deck, but she was three cards from the bottom.

Not going to lie, it was pretty discouraging. If you don't throw Lita at the baddie, you have to whittle away at his 14 HP, all while trying to deal with his 6 evade, or you get slammed with 3 dam/hor *every round*.

**CAMPAIGN WITH BROTHER:** He plays Skids (fighter build) and I play Wendy. I play through the campaign with my wife first, so that we can experience the shocks and surprises of the story together. With my brother, our games are always better because I know what to expect. We wrecked the first scenario and interrogated 3 cultists (almost 4) in the second. We haven't played the third yet.

**CONCLUSION:** The third scenario wasn't just tough, it honestly seemed fairly impossible if you don't draw Lita early in the scenario. We were SO excited about the game and loved the first two scenarios, but that third one is so poorly balanced that it took the wind out of our sails. I'm really reconsidering spending the $70 for the Dunwich campaign, especially because I've heard from other posters that it's easy to get behind the first scenarios and crash and burn mid-campaign.

I have wanted this forever and was excited to place my order.  I’m worried now that my PayPal order with them is sitting in purgatory until a reprint happens… maybe I was wrong in my interpretation that they had inventory as no shipping announcement or email followed… just kinda been quiet.

boardgames,Alternate way to end Lords of Vegas? Thoughts?,False,3,0,"So me and some friends all played Lords of Vegas for the first time last night. Fun game. But we didn’t love the mechanic of how the game ending was time based as opposed to score benchmark based. Now, we’ve only played it once, so I wanted to hear yalls opinions about this who have played it way more. The issue was one player was WAYYYY ahead as we approached the 3/4 mark, turning the game into a situation where there was no real chance of a comeback and thus greatly diminishing the fun for the last 4 turns or so. Is this a rarity? Is it just because we admittedly were playing pretty badly strategy wise since it was everyone’s first time? We were brainstorming about doing something like getting rid of the game over card and instead playing to a set number (70 or so) and then just going through the deck and reshuffling if we reached the end. Has anyone played like that before? Would love yalls thoughts on this. Thanks guys!",,14,,3,,public

boardgames,Good table under $1k?,False,25,0,"So I received my Jasper table last week, and it was riddled with issues unfortunately. So much so that I am actually returning the table. I won't go into details, and I know plenty of people have bought them without any issues, but unfortunately my experience wasn't the same.

I don't want to disparage Board Game Tables, they have been very kind and helpful in the return process and they are a small business, I'm sure getting tables to people across the US is difficult and I commend them for even trying. And I say take my experience with the Jasper with a grain of salt - after all, I did plenty of research before buying a Jasper and the sheer number of positive reviews made it seem like a really safe choice. And it definitely still is, I think I just got rather unlucky.

That experience made me rethink the entire concept of paying so much for a table. I decided paying a massive premium due to the niche nature of board game tables as a product just isn't worth the possible hassle if the QC/shipping gamble doesn't go your way. I was concerned about longevity of the table pretty much the moment I opened the box, which isn't promising from a $1.5k product. Again, this isn't the norm from my research, I just got unlucky.

Anyways: Anyone have any non-board-game table recs? Honestly I've just been looking at IKEA since I live close to one. Used to have a Bjursta from there that I actually quite liked, but sadly they discontinued that table it looks like. But I'm open to any recs from anywhere. Looking for something around 5'x3', definitely no wider than 3'.",,48,,25,custom,public

boardgames,A solo dungeon crawler round-up,False,32,0,"I have sunk an embarrassing amount of time into playing roguelike video games, along with dungeon crawlers. There's something about the challenge they promise along with the difficult but rewarding gameplay that really, truly draws me in. Since switching to playing more solo games I've been searching out different dungeon crawling board games so as to try and get that same experience from a tabletop game. Knowing that a number of people are in this together with me, I thought it might be fun to have a look at the games I've tried so far. Hop along, shall we?

I looked at the following games, arranged by after market prices:  
1. One-card Dungeon  
2. Tin Helm  
3. Mini Rogue  
4. Tiny Epic Dungeons  
5. Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion  
6. Space Hulk fourth edition  

And technically Mage Knight, more on that at the end.

What you'll notice is that I don't play very many massive affairs with long Kickstarter wait times and boxes full of miniatures. I'm finding it very difficult to explain to myself why I would buy a 100+ euro game without having absolute certainty that I will get enjoyment out of the game equal to the value that I've put into it. There's some games on this list (specifically Mage Knight and definitely Space Hulk) that most definitely fall into this category, but I could explain those purchases to myself. Mage Knight I bought second-hand for an excellent price before I dove into the Ultimate Edition, and I had played Space Hulk a ton of times before buying my own copy. What I'm saying is that a game has to do a lot more as a value proposition before I will consider buying it the more expensive it is. 

With that note out of the way, let's get started! 

**One Card Dungeon** - 3 plays
What is it:  
One Card Dungeon is pretty much what it says on the tin - a dungeon crawler that's played on a single card. Both players and enemies are dice being moved around, and your actions each turn come from you assigning dice values to your attributes. Make it through twelve dungeons (done by flipping and rotating the dungeon card) to win!  

Would I recommend it:   
Not really, or more as a novelty. One Card Dungeon is very impressively designed, mostly in that the designers managed to make the enemies in the game feel and behave differently from one another just by tweaking some numbers - it really is impressive. That said, I don't think the game has a lot of replay value after you've made it through a few runs. The dungeon lay-out is the same each time, which is not necessarily a big deal if it wasn't for the fact that you see each floor six times in a single run. Added to that is the fact that the dice-driven gameplay leads to a bunch of dead turns where you only really block and hope to find an attack die that does something next turn. It *is* cheap though, so it might just be worth it to you even if you only really get three plays out of it.  

**Tin Helm** - 7 plays  
What is it:   
Tin Helm is the mint tin version of Iron Helm, available only through the Game Crafters. You play as an adventurer delving through a dungeon in search of relic shards that help you break the curse that... Eminates from this place. You'll be combining the front of one card with the back of another to figure out what terrible stuff will befall you in this dungeon. Throw in some dice chucking and you've got a stew going, baby.  

Would I recommend it:   
Partially I would. I most like this game when the result of the flip is largely unknown. The tension in the game really started to dissipate once I started remembering which cards have things on them that give you shards. However, playing the game is a lot of fun! The dice play and stat management is a whole lot of fun, and the push your luck element of figuring out if a room is better as your destination or as the modifier was really clever. My current hope is that the creator figures out a way to make an expansion for this game like he did for Gate, because I'm definitely not tired of the system.   

**Mini Rogue** - 17 plays  
What is it:  
Mini Rogue is a roguelike dungeon crawler in which you explore different floors of either a tower or a dungeon, getting into fights with bosses along the way. Exploring is done by flipping cards on a 3x3 grid, and getting experience unlocks extra dice to use for checks and combat. Throw in a smattering of unique characters, and that's Mini Rogue!  

Would I recommend it:   
I would! Mini Rogue is about as much fun as you can get from a game this light. The characters and character powers are fun, the game is diverse enough and quick enough to get you into a game quickly and get back out, and the character progression feels real good. That said, I will admit that I tired of the base game after quite a few plays because I kept seeing the same few things over and over again. The expansion stuff for the game helped breathe new life into it for me (especially the new characters - that skeleton guy is rad as hell) but after the amount of plays I've had with it I'm looking for new things. That said, it's a very solid game. I've had a ton of fun with it.  

**Tiny Epic Dungeons** - 4 plays  
What is it:  
The Tiny Epic series is known for cramming a ton of game into a little box filled with stellar production values, and the same is true here. This box in particular has a large number of room tiles that you explore in a 7x7 grid space on the look for mini bosses before you can fight the main boss. Players will acquire loot along the way (including loot sets that grow more powerful the more pieces of the set you have) and pilot their heroes in a fight to beat the boss!  

Would I recommend it:    
This is a tough one for me. I personally like it, but the rules for the game are a bit of a mess and the heavy reliance on iconography makes the game hard to parce. I've never beaten the game so far (which I see as a good thing) but I've also consistently had the feeling that I wasn't playing correctly anyway. The boss fight mechanics are weird as heck and I keep forgetting to take damage whenever I reveal a tile with a monster on it. There's also some weird stuff going on with the expansion and the production of the game. I'm not entirely sure that I like the use of both meeples and miniatures in this game, mostly because the meeples look *so good*. The miniatures are not bad, but I'm not sure they add enough to the game. I more feel like they detract from the game rather than adding much; my suspicion is that they were added because many famous dungeon crawlers use minis and so now they feel they had to (looking at you, Gloomhaven). So, if you want a really tough solo or co-op game while being able to deal with weird production choices and unclear rules, I think you can have a lot of fun with this game. It really does have a LOT of game inside that small box.   

**Gloomhaven - Jaws of the Lion** - 9 plays  
What is it:  
Younger brother to the number one boardgame on BGG, Jaws of the Lion is a more streamlined and beginner friendly gateway to the Gloomhaven system. Players will pick a character and play through a 25 part story in which they level up, encounter events and just beat up a ton of monsters. Combat is done through a thrilling multi-use card system in which played combine two halves of two cards to perform their turn. Add in some hidden goals, deck optimization and a dash of openable boxes, and that's Jaws of the Lion.  

Would I recommend it:    
I do in general, but I'm personally not sold on Gloomhaven as a solo game. I truly love the game as a cooperative experience, mostly because there's nothing quite like it. There's absolute magic in a Gloomhaven turn going tits up that you don't really get in other games, and that facet of the game is fully missing once you introduce perfect information. The solo game is most commonly played by controlling two characters, and to me it really erases the magic that is Gloomhaven. However, if you like the combat system in Gloomhaven and enjoy just doing each turn in that game perfectly, you can't really go wrong. The story is mostly disposable, but the encounters and dungeons are really fun and the design going into each of those encounters is second to none.  

Also, I do want to say that I mind the mixing of miniatures and standees in Gloomhaven a lot less than the mixing of minis and meeples in Tiny Epic Dungeons. I am biased towards meeples over minis, but that aside; the separation of player miniatures and enemy standees helps you quickly parce the board and analyze the board in a way that you don't really get in TED. Maybe it's just a matter of scale, or maybe it's just my heart screaming for gorgeous unique meeples. All I know is that I liked the mix in Gloomhaven and actively disliked it in TED.  

Also also, full disclosure; I've gotten rid of my copy of Jaws of the Lion. I can see myself getting rid of some of the other games on this list in the future, but this is the only game that I have actually gotten rid of at this point in time.  

**Space Hulk fourth edition** - 4 plays (solo)  
What is it:  
""Not a solo game and not a dungeon crawler!"" I hear you yell at your screen. Let me get back to you on that. Before we deal with that though; Space Hulk is a game in which you play a group of genetic super soldiers (Space Marines) who are working through different scenarios in order to complete goals in an attempt to fend off a group of alien super killers (Genestealers). Each side of the conflict uses asymmetric rules and powers to try and crush the other side through some fast and quick dice chucking.  

Would I recommend it:  
So here's the deal. I will recommend Space Hulk to anyone who can get their hands on an affordable copy. Compare Space Hulk to the other games we've discussed here, and you'll see many similarities; grid movement, surviving waves of enemies, coordinating a small group of units. Along with that of course comes the fact that Space Hulk is a fantastic game, both two player and solo. The production value of this game is absolutely bonkers, with the thickest cardboard pieces I've ever seen and the fantastic miniatures that have long been Games Workshop's bread and butter. When it comes to the solo game I personally prefer playing both sides with me trying to win as the Space Marines, although you can find formerly official rules in the BGG files section. I really love how tense and difficult it is to win this game as the Marines, and how much fun it is to try and drink every part of their milkshake as the Tyranids.  

However, I can't in good conscience tell people to go search out a 300 dollar game just to play solo. There's no sense in that. So, either make damn sure that this is *your game* before selling a kidney for a fresh copy.  

**Let's talk about Mage Knight**:  
So for me, Mage Knight is the ultimate version of what I'm looking for in a roguelike dungeon crawler. Except of course for one thing; it's technically not a dungeon crawler. The world isn't a dungeon and you get to basically move around wherever you want. Besides that though, I really do think that there's no game like it when it comes to character progression, power escalation and that good power fantasy that I see most other games on this list try to approach in their own way. Really, give the game a chance. It's good.  

**Conclusion**:  
Bang for your buck, I feel that you're going to get a more rewarding experience out of most of the more expensive boxes, although there's a bunch of creative stuff happening in the cheaper boxes. When it comes to depth of gameplay and replayability though, Gloomhaven and Mage Knight take the cake. If you want the most game for the lowest price, I would personally recommend Mini Rogue over the other options (although Tiny Epic Dungeons is not far behind). This genre is probably the most fun I've had playing a solo game, and I can't wait to find out what else there is for me to explore.  

Also, feel free to leave suggestions and recommendations in the comments! If it's affordable I'll definitely try and check it out.",,28,,32,mage-knight,public

EDIT: I didn't realize I should have given some reviews or a tier list.  I'll make sure to add some thoughts to this post later tonight.  

Alright, here's my top 10 and bottom 5.  I got 3/4ths of the way through compiling a very in-dept response, but my computer crashed and I lost it all.  That in mind, I'll keep some of this pretty short - but I'm happy to expand on my thoughts. 


**TOP TEN:**

**Wingspan** – I like this because it is a slow to medium paced game where you have to make difficult and crucial decisions each round.  Your Engine will be different each time, and there are a ton of strategies to try out.  It also does not really feel like a competitive game even though it is, and I like that I can basically just focus on what I’m doing.  It’s almost like putting together a puzzle next to someone doing the same.  The expansions are not necessary, but I do recommend them.  The Europe one adds a lot of cards, and the Oceania expansion adds cards in addition to a new resource/mechanic.

**Radlands** – I can’t stress enough how much I love this game.  It is a competitive card game based on destroying your opponents three bases, while protecting your own.  Each game feels like an epic tug-of-war of attrition.  Every time I think I’m about to win, my opponent takes a turn and completely takes the wind out of my strategy.  It’s a game that forces you to be aware of everything on each board, and to adapt quickly when things go wrong.  I’m not sure if it is the production value that draws me in so much (I have the version with the playmats and chunky plastic tokens), or the constant emotional rollercoaster that makes me love it so much..  I have always like the concept of Magic, but there is just an overwhelming amount of content and mechanics to deal with so it never clicked.  I feel like Radlands has the same general feel of Magic, but in a much more streamlined package. 

**Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition** – I have only been able to play about 3 games of this, but holy cow do I love it.  I love strategically trying to figure out how to make the best engine to get the resources to terraform Mars.  This is another competitive game that doesn't feel competitive, I just kind of chill and do my thing.

**Dice Throne, AKA BATTLE DICE.** - This is just a really cool concept that was executed really well.  The production value is insane, the games feel balanced, and it has an easy entry point for people who don't play a lot of board games.  Plus, it is just pure dumb fun to roll dice.  This one hits the table a lot because it's one of the few that bot Myself and my Partner enjoy a lot.

**Dice Throne Adventures** - I mean, it mixes Dice Throne with one of my favorite genres - Roguelite Dungeon Crawler.  There is a ton of content to explore, including 4 big boss fights, so it feels like you really get your money's worth.  I really love that you get to upgrade your deck between sessions, and I like that it gives you the option to make Dice Throne cooperative.

**Pandemic Legacy/Pandemic Games** - Pandemic was the first board game I played as an adult, around 2012.  My partner at the time an I played probably 50+ sessions and were just obsessed with it, so it's a gimme to have in the collection.  I picked up Call of Cthulu as well, which is similar in concept, but executed differently.  It's pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's more amazing than Pandemic.  What is amazing is Pandemic Legacy Season 1.  It took me a while to pull the trigger because of the cost of entry, but I am glad I picked it up.  I love the stress that comes from knowing that your session is going to permanently alter your experience going forward.  It feels wrong to rip up a card, but that's part of the thrill.

**Codenames** - This is just a fun game to play socially with people who don't really board game.  The concept is simple and point of entry is low.  It also usually ends in a lot of laughter because ""WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE POSSIBLY MEANT?!""

**Tiny Epic Galaxies** - Everyone I have tried to play this with hates it, which sucks because I think it is brilliant.  I like having to make difficult decisions on what to do with your rolls, and collecting planets is fun.  Not much more to say than that

**Gloomhaven JOTL** - Absolutely love this game.  It is increadibly in depth, has a massive amount of content, and forces you to be highly strategic.  I have only been able to play two sessions with a friend, but I'm really hoping to get it on the table more.  I love RPG's, so this game holds a lot of value to me.

**Trash Pandas** - I will be honest, I have no idea why I love this game.  It is not on anyone's list, no one talks about it, it's a overly simple concept of rolling dice to gain actions.  It's just chill to play in-between more complex games.  I just like it.

**BOTTOM FIVE:**

**Side Effects** -  Honestly I did not expect anything great from this, so I can't really be mad.  The concept is fun and the art is pretty good, and it just seemed kind of novel.  I'll likely never get this one on the table, so it will probably just take up space until I need it for something else.

**Flux** - A game that develops as you go is fun in theory, but in practice it just feels like work trying to keep everything straight. And that's just how I feel about the base game, some of the others are just unnecessarily complicated.

**Cuphead** - Love the art, love the production value, love Cuphead.  Hate the damn game itself though.  It feels like there's not enough time to actually get your actions, and you have barely any health so it's tough to get through one of the decks.  I'm keeping it as a collector's item, but it's unlikely that it will make it to the table again.

**Ticket to Ride** - My partner loves this, so it will stay in my collection, but I just find it kind of boring.  It's an easy game to teach people, so it's great for sessions with people who don't play a lot... but it's just not that fun to me.  

**Forbidden Island** - Look, it's ""*fine*"".  I got it because it looked cool on tabletop, and I like cooperative games.  What I found, however, is that this is basically ""My First Cooperative Game"".  It just feels like Pandemic watered down, nothing to really write home about.  It's easy enough to teach people, so I'll probably keep it for now... at least until I want something that can take the space.


I did not put Arkham Horror LCG anywhere, but I want to acknowledge it.  Everyone loves this game, I kind of get why.  My problem is that it has entirely too much going on, and I have no idea how to play after doing 6+ hours of going through the rulebooks and watching videos.  There are just too many questions that come up which aren't easy to answer quickly.  I would probably love this game if I had someone experienced to sit through it with me and help me understand how certain situations should play out.  I could also just be dumb and lazy, completely possible.",,109,,58,,public

The game was a space in a spiral looking layout. The sun or black hole (can’t remember which) is expanding and will eat and consume all the planets. Each player is a nation that is moving operations and ships to other planets or moons and what not. Each nation is contributing to a mega ship ark that will take off and leave the solar system. 

Each player wants to leave influence of their country on the ark ship. So researching and accomplishing tasks is how you do so. As time goes on the sun or black hole sucks the tile spaces towards the center and eats those spaces until you run out. 

He said he was interested in it but couldn’t afford it. I think it was plastic heavy.

If I can’t post this here then sorry and I will take it down.",,47,,29,,public

**What do I get for winning?**

A copy of my game, Can't Touch This. It is a 1-2 player set collection game played on 1 card and with 6 paperclips. Each card has a **computer generated layout**, and if you have some paperclips laying around, you can print and play it for free directly from [my website](https://www.jorgezhang.com/2021/12/cant-touch-this/index.html)!

I am working on self-publishing my upcoming social deduction/logic matrix game, Orp - The Market for Space Merchant Translators (expected release in early 2023), and I would like to know which of the following 6 alien words is your favorite design! The main twist that differentiates Orp from other social deduction games is the fact that you know the translation to 1 of 6 alien words instead of receiving a secret role. Your goal is to decipher the meaning of each alien word and obtain the correct items for your wealthy client!

You can also just comment whatever you want- the above is just a suggestion.

boardgames,"[Self-Promotion] I've been working for 5 years on a Pokemon-inspired game that's played with Poker cards, and the first prototype arrived!",False,30,0,"[Here it is!](https://imgur.com/a/kIwEcq2)

The game is called Enmity Engine. It's a horror-themed fighting card game for 2 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes (but can be as quick as 10-15 minutes if you're used to playing). It works like this: Each player has a team composed of 3 Fighters and a deck of Poker cards. Both players have one Active Fighter out at any given time that face off against each other.

Each round, both players take 1 action, then choose a move by setting a card from their hand face-down. Once both players are done, they reveal their face-down cards and, depending on what move cards they chose, resolve their moves, which will either cause them to Attack or Switch their Active Fighter.

Over the course of the game, your Fighters generate a resource called Insight, which can be spent to Awaken them to upgrade their abilities or launch their Signature Moves (kinda like Mega Evolutions and Z-Moves, to borrow Pokemon's terms).

The game ends when one player's Fighters are defeated, after which the other player wins the game.

After playing simultaneous reveal fighting card games like Yomi, BattleCON, and Exceed for a while, I noticed that they were the closest we had to a tabletop version of competitive Pokemon, and that inspired me to start working on this game. Over the years I spent working on it, it's changed form drastically multiple times as I tried to figure out how moveset customization would work, starting from being a Sakura Arms-style dueling game where you construct your card pool after looking at your opponent's options, to being a handbuilder, to being a Smash-Up style shuffle-builder, to being a deckbuilder, until finally I decided to just axe customization to get what we have now.

And I'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out. For one, it made playtesting/balancing much less of a nightmare, but it also makes it a breeze to setup and play. Half the setup is basically just choosing 3 Fighters and shuffling up your Poker deck, which makes it easy to just play like 10 games in a row, since there's so little downtime.

If you're interested in the game, please check out the website I set up for it, where you can find a sample print &amp; play and rules PDF.

For example goes all in on someone in the first round in a strategy game, just to knock out someone who had ""wronged"" him in a previous game, even when his move does not make sense.

boardgames,"Magic words required: I want to sell a game my wife absolutely hates, but she wants to keep.",False,54,0,"The game in question is SCYTHE. We mostly play cooperative games because she is extremely conflict sensitive, but agreed to give this a shot because of the art and my hype about it. This was last Christmas, where we got the game as a gift from my mom.

Our experience, despite houserules of not attacking / stealing from each other (which arguably gutted the game as tension, even without action, is a huge part of it), is abysmal. Every single time we played across this almost 1 year, she lost. She doesn't even want to know her score for some time now, which makes me not want to care about... Any of it, all of it! What's the point of a conpetitive game where you compare points if the other player doesn't want her points counted and compared? Then it was annoyance that the game ends when I reach 6 stars, and that her plans are left unfinished. Sure, do that, we keep playing. We finish it when she had 6 stars too, in the meantime I suffered through stacking money, won, and it was just as bad all the same.

We tried to play it with extended family as group of 5. She is somewhere in the middle by the end, but doesn't want her points counted. I win with 3 stars and 90 points, extended family while had fun, score 70-20. They like tge game, they don't mind losing because they are like me, they enjoy losing as long as they learn, improve, and feel smarter after every game. She cannot be like that when she is facing other players.

She hates all of it from her guts, and because of that, I developed a very strong distain, even disgust of the thought of putting on the desk.

Before I get relationship advices, her happiness is the most important to me, and I avoid suggesting SCYTHE. But she does put it on the table, I know she does it from a sense of guilt, the she made me hate it, something I was very happy about the ""honeymoon phase"", something my mom gifted us/me. 

I explained to her in detail, that boardgames are an activity we share, playing by definition is having fun doing something we enjoy and getting better at it or being comfortable where we are. Our experience differs with this game so much, that even if I used to like it, I hate to see her being miserable and I would prefer to play anything else instead, including our many coop games (she is a freaking master of Spirit Island! ♥️). It's okay to feel the way she feels about the experience she had, and I don't blame her or hold her responsible or resent her. We tried, on her request more than mine, to make it work and it does not work for us, and that's okay. That's why I want to sell it, because it just catches dust otherwise, and we could invest that money into games / expansions she likes, that we like. 

Nope, don't sell it! She made an incredibly pretty, printed on think paper, colored insert. A huge setvof boxes found on bgg files, and spent 5 hours cutting and gluing them. So we played again. And she is miserable, again. My distain towards the game is through the roof. Her sense of guilt, no matter what I say, is through the roof. Regarding extended family, they like SCYTHE, but not enough to not play something we are having more fun with (Terraforming Mars, Bang dice, Meadow, Last Bastion, Pandemic Rome, the list goes on), and honestly I don't care about if they'll miss it or not, I care about my wife's feelings first. 

How the hell do I get her to understand the issue here is not her, and that we should reforge (by selling) the game into something we like? Her dedication to me is lovely, but in this particular case, very unhealthy I think, and I cannot say this at the same time with ""it's not your fault"", because she keeps mixing these things as if saying this is paradoxical.",,112,,54,,public

Now, I like Bananagrams. But it has become too much. I need another word game to put in the mix. Growing up, she played Scrabble with us but not much else.

Today was the technical street date for Horizons even though some have been able to score it slightly earlier depending if their local target store follows street dates on the pallets. 
I just wanted to let everyone know my thoughts. I double checked and the cards in the game (minus spirit powers) are all the same with just some minor verbage changes to help you understand the game better. There are no new fear, minor or major power cards in the game. The spirit panels are made from the same material that the cards are- which in my opinion is better because they can store in my base box with no issues. Also the spirit tokens are teal, dark red, and yellow so we now have more colors to choose from. Overall I am super stoked about having this set in addition to the other content.

A lot of us ended up having turns where, after scoring our word, we wouldn't have enough points to purchase any of the letters from the offer. Now, there is an optional rule that lets place discount cubes on available letters which make them progressively cheaper as they remain available. We played it again tonight using that rule, and it totally got rid of the problem we had before and made the game much more fun.

That same day I had received my copy of Terraforming Mars and both asked if we could try that instead since it looked cool. I was absolutely down, but told them we'd have to learn it together since I've never played it. We went through on some tutorials on YouTube and for the next SIX HOURS we learned and played and it was a shit show but seriously some of the most fun I've ever had in my life. The ending was even crazier because of how close we all were (I had 57 points, the other two had 58 and 61). I only have a few friends open to trying board games and the fact that they were both eager to try it made me so happy.

boardgames,So I guess I own a badly worn copy of a shitty edition of my least favorite board game now,False,863,0,"So I'm at a church tag sale, always the best tag sales because no one has any idea what anything is worth so they underprice everything.

They have the usual assortment of horrible mass market kids games, but I decided to look at an old copy of *Castle Risk,* because while I fucking hate *Risk* and the box of this particular copy was pretty damaged, some editions come with little castles and tanks and knights on horseback as pieces and you can keep the pieces for other, better games. *Axis and Allies* and *Monopoly City* are amazing for their repurposable minis and tokens.

And I open it up carefully, because even if it sucks it's still a board game so board game careful mode automatically flips on in my brain, and I notice that nope these pieces are fucking trash, the troop markers are random little plastic X's that literally look like sprue waste left over from making something better out of plastic. Even the castles, which one would imagine are the raison d'etre for a game called ""Castle Risk,"" are tiny and ugly.

Well, as I'm closing the box in disgust, this incredibly sweet little old lady comes over delighted that I'm looking at the game,  and explains how it was her grandson's favorite game as a boy, and she'd be so glad if it found a new home with someone who would treasure it, and no one else had noticed it even though the tag sale was nearly over now, etc. etc.

So now I own a badly worn copy of a shitty edition of my least favorite board game. At least it was only 50 cents. Don't buy *Castle Risk*.

- Worker Placement + Deck Building - ex: Dune Imperium &amp; Lost Ruins of Arnak (adds in a restriction of card locations)
- Bag Building - ex: Orleans (like worker placement, but you are drawing characters out of a bag you are building each with restrictions on where they can be placed)
- Player Board Selection - ex: Scythe (selecting one pair of actions from your board) 
- Action Selection Restricted by Dice Rolling - ex: Khora (select actions based on cards, but you are restricted by what you roll on dice)

You can play as the French, English, or Spanish colonial governor or the micco of the Creek Confederation. It’s a game of resource management and diplomacy, where you will trade and make alliances w smaller American Indian nations to gain an advantage. It’s inspired by the real history of the Southeast, which did involve a complex wheeling and dealing between colonial and indigenous powers.

My question is where do you draw the line on what’s appropriate in a historical game?
Slave raiding and slave revolts were a huge part of the diplomatic and economic interchange of the groups in the game. I kind of want to make slaves or captives an in-game resource and give players a reason to conduct slave raids or arm slave revolts against each other like in real life. The problem is that i worry that people wont be comfortable using slaves as a resource in the game. Maybe it shouldn’t be comfortable 🤷🏻‍♂️ i dont want to whitewash what really happened. I think there should also be an option for a colonial player to wipe out a small tribe like they really did, but again is that too horrible to make it part of the game? Obviously you could choose not to, or to abolish slavery with certain tradeoffs, but is it a problem for it to just be possible?
The game is meant to teach about a dark part of history, but I don’t want it to offend or disgust people. I havent heard anyone complaining that you have to play as nazis in Axis and Allies, though.

The tiles/cards helped to create the dungeon, we would play on the floor as it would get pretty big. The tiles were different, with each giving up to three new directions to go in (e.g. shaped like a ‘+’ or ‘L ‘or ‘l-‘). I think some had ladders or stairs but we ignored them as I was young and it seemed complicated. 

Some of the characters I remember were the Hero, Heroine, I think there were dragons, and I’m sure there was one Sybil character who if you found ended the game/defeated your team/couldn’t join your group. 

I think we bought the game in London in the 90s/early 00s but it was secondhand so not sure how old it actually was. I think it was in an orange or pale pink box, and I think there was a 6-sided dice 🎲

Now I'm practicing on [boardgamearena.com](https://boardgamearena.com), meeting and play with people. My win rate is just about 50% now... but FYI. That's not really important.

Okay, now we are in the main part.  
As I knew before, a 2-player game is much more controllable but also harder, and more competitive. Literally battle. My main tactics are mostly:  
1/ ""Hit the (tier) 3"", then move to another color at 2 or 3 tier, collect gems and cards that help and related to other that is necessary to win (a.k.a Sprinter). Weakness are, when I got blocked (crucial in 2-players) I f\*\*\* up, and have to slowly work around, wasting turns.   
2/""Be flexible"" which is dependent on the cards. If it seems to not ""related"" I get stuck and just... work around? 

So I need some advises on:  
1/ The no.1 tactic, what should I do when I got blocked and contingency plans to win?  
2/ Also, another weakness of mine is I reluctant to block other players (I used to do that back then), but how should you block to not choke yourself later on?  
3/ How to be more ""flexible"" in the game?  
4/ Is there any other strategies that I didn't know instead of the ""Hit the 3"" (which seems effective for less turn, high value/points)? Honestly, 4 years ago mostly everyone in our circle play that game and they block each other to prevent that. Yet I want to know some other way too.

boardgames,Essen 2021 - how did the games I bought there fare?,False,96,0,"Essen 2021 – a haul retrospective

2021 was my first Essen, and I think we can all agree that new people are more prone to excess that those who have been around the block a few times – enter your kind narrator. Given that it was my first Essen, I felt that I had to buy all the games that looked good or otherwise fear that I would never again be able to find them. The FOMO really got to me. Luckily I’ve now seen that not to be the case at all (not even the promos were exclusive to Essen!), meaning that I can go to Essen 2022 with a noticeably lower desire to acquire. However, I thought it might be fun to take a look at the games I bought at Essen 2021 and see how well they fared in my collection. 
For this, I’ll be talking about the games I’ve bought, the number of plays they each had and my reviews in brief. Should you be curious about specific games, feel free to drop a comment. 

**Art Robbery** – 10 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Art Robbery is one of the filler-type games that gets the most play around my house. I’ve got the teach down to a slim two minutes, and I’ve also got the soundtrack down pat. It really is quite Knizia. I still stand by most of the stuff I’ve said in my review, except for the fact that I have had some games of this that were not fun for everyone. I’m A-ok with people consistently stealing my stuff, because I find it hilarious and the game will be over in ten minutes anyway. However, I have had games where people are consistently frustrated that they don’t draw cards that let them do anything they feel is meaningful while consistently getting their stuff stolen. Touch with caution. 

**Golem** - 5 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! I wrote a long piece where I analyzed the cultural history in this game, and I stand by most of what I said there. That said, I have encountered some real problems that stop me from getting it to the table more. The teach is an absolute BEAR, mostly because the game is such an icon soup. I’m also finding that the core gameplay loop is becoming less and less satisfying the more times I play it, because there’s such little interaction. I can see this getting the axe in the future. 

**LUNA Capital**- 5 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! I bought this game mostly because a number of YouTube people were raving about it and I found the artwork cute, but I ended up not liking the core gameplay that much. The tile tower is fiddly, even though you would expect that not to matter that much, and the stuff with the cards… I would just rather be playing Azul, which I feel covers much the same ground while being a lot more streamlined and transparent. Bit of a dud for me, this one. 

**MicroMacro Crime City – full house** - 1 play  
Do I still own it: I do! Mostly because we haven’t really gotten around to playing this one much. I really like MicroMacro though, so I’m just saving this one for a rainy day. I like the little quality of life improvements for families now that they have added little icons that indicate what type of case you can expect, as it helps parents who want to play together with their kids make more educated choices of what type of content they want to expose their kids to. 

**Mindbug** - 4 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! It ended up being too thin for me. The main draw of this game was that it was kind of like squeezing all the water and fat out of Magic the Gathering, ending up with this super sleek game that could be taught and played in mere minutes. For me though, the end result was a game that just didn’t really do much for me. It felt a little bland, like some soul was missing. A soul that can’t be plastered over by any kind of goofy artwork. 

**MOON ADVENTURE** - 7 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! I did really like Moon Adventure, but I just don’t really play that many cooperative games. This one in particular felt really hard to do well, as the Ion Storms can just absolutely mess you up even though you’ve been very careful. I like the core system (which is why I do still own Deepsea Adventure), but this cooperative take did not end up setting my world on fire. 

**Railroad Ink Challenge – Lush Green** - 6 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! I really like this one! Railroad Ink is always nice and mindful, and I’m pretty much always satisfied with the end result. There’s just something very soothing about making a little train route, even though this one does a good job of putting on the pressure more. I personally prefer the trails expansion over the trees expansion, even though both are good. This is also the version of Railroad Ink Challenge that I recommend people get. It’s a good game! 

**SCOUT** - 4 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Scout is just a great, great, great little game, as you may have been told over the last few months. The cardplay feels really fun, I like the theme well enough (my SO and I made it a tradition to tell the other players the names of the cards we’ve played) and there’s something unique about the cards in this game. Recommended, assuming there will be a time where you can actually acquire it. 

**The Siege of Runedar** - 6 plays  
Do I still own it: I don’t! The Siege of Runedar was REALLY FUN while it lasted though. I didn’t end up falling in love with the core system, and the lack of variability (besides difficulty) ended up killing the game for me. Each game played much too similarly, which ended up with me using the same strategies over and over again. I had my fun exploring the system, so now it’s time to pass it onto someone else. 

**Whitehall Mysteries** - 3 plays  
Do I still own it: I do! Whitehall Mysteries, to me, is just the strictly superior version of the Letters to Whitechapel system. It’s lean, it’s easy to understand, it’s quick, it’s incredibly tense; I really do love it a lot. It is currently my favourite hidden movement game, although I’ve heard good things about Sniper Elite and MIND MGMT. I’ve got Beast underway from Kickstarter sometime before December, we’ll wait and see if that game can claim the title. As it stands though, Whitehall Mysteries really is what I love about the system as a whole. It’s tense, excruciating turns followed either by having the cops on your heels or feeling like you’re a criminal mastermind. I cannot recommend this game enough, even though I realize that it is quite difficult to get at the moment.   

**FINAL SCORE**  
Games bought: 10  
Games still in collection: 6  

Not a bad score actually! There’s some games on here that I’m a little salty about (mostly LUNA Capitol) and one that I can see leaving in the not-so-distant future (Golem), but as it stands I do feel that this is a pretty good score. Having said that, I do feel it important to again emphasize (to myself as much as others, to be honest) that Essen should not only be about acquiring new games but also about simply playing and enjoying the con. Last year I went by myself; this year I will be going together with three of my friends. I cannot wait to share this whole new experience with them.

**Marco Polo** is of course the best example I know of. It's a dice placement game, but one character can just set their dice to whatever they want. Another earns resources every time other players collect them from the board. Yet another player starts at the finish line, giving them better opportunities to gather up bonuses.

**Clans of Caledonia** is yet another excellent example, as are its inspiration **Terra Mystica** and **Gaia Project**

boardgames,Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan VS Granada: Last Stand of the Moors,False,17,0,"Hey guys!  


I played Sekigahara and  had a blast, what a great game! But it's out of print everywhere. I signed up for the fifth print in GMT's P500, but who knows when the game will be finally released.  


And searching a little I discovered this other game called Granada: Last Stand of the Moors, that is a spiritual sucessor of Sekigahara, great art and basically  the same rules with a few additions like ships etc... I'm a little on the fence about getting a copy of Granada now  or wait for Sekigahara's print. Any opinions comparing both games?",,11,,17,,public
boardgames,How do you guys play mafia (werewolf)?,False,7,0,"So some people brought the mafia game from Russia to our country and opened a club and a league for that. They claim they are playing the official competitive version with World Competition rules:  


* The game is for exactly 10 + Moderator
* It always has the same roles: 5 townsmen, 1 Sherif, two regular mafias, and a Don(mafia's boss)
* On the first night, the don decides with the mafia on who to kill (static or by the pattern for the advanced player)
* During the day everyone has one minute to talk; they are not allowed to talk outside of their minute
* during the night the mafia marks the Moderator who they kill without opening their eyes. if they don't choose the same person they miss and no one dies.
* Also, during the night the Sherif can search for the mafia and the Don for the Sherif.
* From the second we can start eliminating people, everyone must vote at the end of the round.
* Talking out of your time, touching, cursing, be emotional gives you a strike. on 3 strikes you are losing your minute on four you are out.
* Strike during the night count as four strikes.

The game is over when there are no more mafias, or the mafia is equal to the number of players.  
So I looked for a kit for that and found only mafia games with a lot of roles and very different from what we played...  


So maybe it is a simple version? I know it sounds simple, but we have hand signs to mark things when we are not allowed to talk, and the game can go very deep with the strategies :-)",,15,,7,,public

boardgames,Specific game mechanics that elevate a game from competent to sublime?,False,35,0,"I'll start with a few:

**Arkham Horror LCG** - the chaos bag; essentially a modular 16-sided die, the chaos bag allows for customizable difficulty. There is something so exhilarating about groping in the bag before drawing, knowing that I'm brushing against success and failure, and that I control which destiny I pull. The clackity-clack of coin capsules makes this experience even better! The game itself is great, but the chaos bag makes it one of the best of all time.

**Spirit Island** - the invader track; allows the players to see into the future and anticipate invader actions before they act, allowing you to optimize every move and plan for their demise with meticulous glee. Made even better by the Event deck, which adds just enough unpredictability to throw off your best-laid plans",,64,,35,,public

boardgames,"For me, Food Chain Magnate is the perfect game.",False,348,0,"This game is brilliant. It brings lots of interaction and it’s all about reacting to what others are doing. The theme is perfect and it really feels like you are competing against other rival food chains. Yes it can be mean, but when someone undercuts me, I can’t help but be impressed that they saw something I didn’t. There are so many strategies and paths you can take, some conventional and some less. I love this game and will be playing it for years to come. Thank you Splotter!!

boardgames,Azul: how do I calculate probability of a factory having at least 3 blues?,False,14,0,"I started wondering this today but I haven't touched this kind of math for quite a while...

Say, with the initial board setup with 2 players (20 per color, 5 factories).

What's the probability of having at least one factory with at least 3 blues?

I think I know how to calculate for the first factory (choosing 4 tiles from a 100):

(20 choose 3) \* (80 choose 1) / (100 choose 4) + (20 choose 4) / (100 choose 4)

But with 4 other factories, it seems to get complicated.

Ultimately, I'd like to generalize it to any board setup. Say, in second round, with a distribution of \[16, 17, 15, 12, 20\], probability of at least k etc.

Thanks!

**Edit:** Wow. Thanks for your wonderful answers. That was a fun thought exercise. TLDR seems like a hard problem and writing a simulation is the easiest. Will write one and report back.  
**Edit 2:** For those interested, as suggested, I wrote a simple program to simulate a 2p board of azul and gotten the following probability after sampling 20 tiles from 100 tiles for 10M times.   
\- number of factories that have at least 1 blue: 29836914 (59.67%)  
\- number of factories that have at least 2 blues: 8878900 (17.76%)  
**- number of factories that have at least 3 blues: 1223261 (2.45%)**  
\- number of factories that have at least 4 blues: 61944 (0.12%)  
Note: Since there are 5 factories each round, so the denominator for calculating the percentage is 50M.

boardgames,"[Tabletop Sim] Introducing ""Shrapnel!"", my own free card war boardgame",False,29,0,"Hello folks.

This week I was bored out of my mind and playing Sid Meier's Gettysburg, and decided to do something with all that excitement.

Here be Shrapnel!, my first ever boardgame, and one that I am proud of. The pitch would be: *""Deploy your Napoleonic Era unit cards in a 6x6 grid, where facing, flanking and terrain are the name of the game. With unique cards representing seven different nations, a game of Shrapnel! can be resolved to its bloody conclusion in just under 30 minutes.""*

Because I just want people to try it, it's not printed or anything -- yet! Here's a [Tabletop Simulator link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2866775752) for people to give it a shot (pun not intended). Of course, game's totally free, I earn nothing, all images are credited. I hope you guys enjoy playing it as much as I did making it.

I made a video tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/nwxx5AXzGZM) to explain the setup and first turn.

##FAQ

**I live in Haiti/Canada/Costa Rica/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the Nigerian prince won't answer my emails anymore!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on WAAAGH!, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

boardgames,Tips and advice for a after school board games club,False,29,0,"Hello all, as the title suggests I'm hoping to run an after school board games club. The session will be roughly an hour and 15 minutes, once a week. 

Some background: I work at a UK school, and the club will be aimed at key stage two (7-10 years old roughly). 

I just wanted some ideas, advice and any board game recommendations that I haven't thought of myself.

Obviously my first session will be more about getting to know the kids, their experiences and what they've played and anything they'd like to try. I will also be writing a contract with some simple guidelines and expectations as a lot of the games will be from my own collection. 

The games that I own and I am thinking of using are: 
Dobble 
Speedy words 
Cobra paw 
Timeline 
Anomia 
Dominoes 
Top trumps 
Guess who 
Colour brain 
Herd mentality 
Word on the street 
Abalone 
Machi koro 
Love letter 
Marrakech 
Codenames 
5 second rule 

If you can suggest any others that would be great. I am of course going to have the basic and easy to play games like snakes and ladders, etc. As each week I will focus on introducing one new game and teach it to a group and then help them to teach it to the other members.",,16,,29,,public

In short, I'm not sure my group will ""handle"" Root since, from what I've read, it's a pretty complex game and our group prefers smaller, lighter games. That said, one of our friends, and my wife, enjoy deep tactical experiences, so who knows?

I just grabbed the digital version and am really enjoying running the tutorials to teach myself the factions. Just curious as to which faction you enjoy most, and which you think is most beginner friendly!",,18,,6,,public

You use a standard deck and split it into sets of 4 (face down) and distribute them evenly among 2-6 players.

It's not particularly old, BUT it's now better known in the streamlined and prettier 2nd edition form. Does the first edition still hold up today, or has it been completely outclassed by PP2.0?

What I do know is that they're very different games, and I don't expect to have a chance to play PP2.0 any time soon... so should I just wait for who knows how long until I get a shot at 2.0, or is 1.2 worth the time investment for now?

boardgames,Hostage Negotiation,False,6,0,"**TLDR**: I know two people in two separate game groups who both take the games hostage when playing. What are your negotiation tactics to help move a game along?

Important- They both insist on playing, will even plan/host game nights and pick the games.

One of them gets chatty about irl situations/opinions, not pay attention to other’s moves or plan ahead (and pulls his convo partner out of the game mentally too), stalls the game on his turn for 10-20 minutes to continue the chat, and repeatedly even admits and laughs when he does so. Even the lightest of games turns into a slog.

The other stalls with massive AP, and will often rewind moves (sometimes 2-3 times) to min max the outcome before he passes.

They’re both friends, and the AP time traveler is my main connection to a larger group of gamers.

I’ve mentioned politely it’s their turn. I’ll put a soft time frame on a game by mentioning I need to leave around a certain time. I’ve reduced my attendance to some game nights, but would like to still join them.

boardgames,"Thinking about investing in Twilight Imperium, but am a bit intimidated. Need advice.",False,15,0,"I've been heavily involved in the boardgame hobby for about 10 years now, and own around 70 games (of which I play about 20 on a fairly regular basis).  Currently my wife and I are about 20% done with Crimson Scales, and loving it immensely.

I've always avoided Twilight Imperium because of the sheer weight of the game (both physically and mentally) and the cost (both financially and time-wise).  But recently I've been drawn to it for various reasons, and after watching about 6 videos on 'how to' as well as playthrough, I am really considering it.  However, I have some questions and concerns:

1. how steep is the learning curve?  Do you have it mostly figured out after playing an hour or two, or do you need to play it through a few times before you really know what you're doing?
2. if I've played the game myself a few times, and want to introduce it to a friend, is there any chance a newbie can win when playing their first game, or would it be no contest (this is obviously related to question 1 above)
3. will serious, strategic gamers always prevail over casual players?  In other words, can someone just play for fun and still compete based on (perhaps) some luck, or does a few mistakes sort of steamroll into a losing campaign?  Can you catch up if way behind?
4. can you pretty much tell who is NOT going to win after 3 hours?  If you play a 4-player game, and you come in last place, did you know you were certain to lose for several hours, or did you have realistic hope all the way until the end (maybe the last 30 minutes) that you had a chance?
5. If 4 people are all newbies, playing for the 1st time, would it make sense to play the game for an hour or two, and then start over (everything new) for a better understood experience?  If I get the game and share it with friends, we'll all be noobs, and I think knowing what you're doing is more fun than guessing.

Any other advice would be appreciated.  Thanks!

My wife flooded the bathroom last night and it started leaking through the floor directly onto our boardgame shelf in the basement.

But seriously, I just happened to have a crappy Walmart Guess Who knockoff along with a couple of games still in shrinkwrap on the top shelf and they maganed to shield most of the games below from the worst of it. We were able to get everything moved away and toweled off quickly so only 3 or 4 boxes got some water stains. I don't think anything inside was damaged from the look of it.

Aaaaanyway, that corner of the house is really the only space we can reasonably fit these games, but we are worried about flooding again.

To this day, we're still not really sure how they found out about us, but the Times reached out and the reporter sat in on one of our gamenights.   He then called most of the 'core' group for followup phone interviews before the article appeared in a sunday edition.

My initial idea was to take a hair drier to the corner to soften it then slowly reshape it with a metal ruler that I have but I'm far from a ""handy"" person and have never done box repair before so I figured I'd ask the community (that's you) before I accidentally destroy my box.

boardgames,Gloomhaven Scenario 44,False,3,0,"I could not beat this scenario for anything.  Not even coming close. Playing solo failed horribly with 2 characters (lvl8 Summoner &amp; lvl3 Berzerker).  Tried again by adding a lvl4 Sunkeeper, thinking it’s heal and bless abilities would help. Nope.  Ditched the Sunkeeper and tried adding a lvl4 Scoundrel.  That helped but still nowhere close to even killing the enemies in the second large room.  Exasperated, I turned to the interwebs and discovered the few subtleties that made all the difference. Tried again using Redthorn and my characters differently and absolutely stomped my way through.  

I’m only halfway through GH with a Kickstarter FH “soon” to be delivered.  I won’t even open FH until I’ve gotten my fill of GH, but things like Scenario 44 are part of why I really enjoy the game.

boardgames,Any good house rules for getting a complete Gloomhaven experience?,False,2,0,"So I played Gloomhaven on TTS during the pandemic with friends. My group and I met every Sunday evening to play through a scenario; after a about 4 or 5 it became clear that it would take multiple playthroughs for us to experience everything the game has to offer, all of the characters, items, side quests etc.

Whilst we really enjoyed the experience, realistically none of us were ever going to play it through from beginning to end again, at least for the foreseeable future, which made me regret not being able to try all the classes and unlocks. One of the house rules we implemented to at least try and boost our party was that we would be allowed to claim all coins and treasure chests on a map if at the end of the scenario no monsters were still in play; even still, we did not get to experience everything the game had to offer. 

With Frosthaven now due in a couple of months I’m wondering what house rules or changes people would recommend to get the most out of it (assuming somewhat similar progression and unlock mechanics)?

boardgames,Finally got a dedicated board game shelf!,False,89,0,"And I'm darn sure proud of it! I've been involved with the hobby since early 2019, starting slowly, and building up to now. First game was Twilight Imperium 4ed, and that didnt got so well, lol. After that, I got Scythe, which we used to play 2-3 times an evening. It is probably still my single most played game, not counting Gloomhaven.  I just love discovering new, unique worlds board games can bring into my home - and I'd dare say I'd give any oddity and a weird game a fair chance and try.

Wouldnt change much really - I heard all the horror stories of game collections reaching eldritch proportions that refuse to be tamed, but then again, I'd sure love more games, but I'd also love to somehow get the time needed to play them. And i hate reaching for the rulebook, and teaching has been getting tiresome lately. I still kinda miss the feeling we had while Scythe was more or less the only game - everyone knew the rules perfectly, no consulting the rulebook, games are fast, and so on. Lately tho, I fell out of love with Scythe - while I still love its more or less unique ""cold war"" gameplay, where the threat of combat is probably all you are gonna see until the very late game, and its presentation and table presence are amazing - I sorta grew disillusioned with it over its game balance. Invaders from Afar, while being quite fun to play, feel a hell lot weaker than base game factions, and certain combinations are just plain bad. Sadly, Scythe isnt much like say Root, where the shaky balance can be self-regulated by the gameplay itself, due to its focus on the threat of combat instead of combat itself. I'm also sorta collectionist - I insist on having every single expansion, promo or module, which can cause a slight headache from time to time.

Still have lots of empty space tho, and i just love discovering new, unique games. Any suggestions with what to fill it? I've been thinking of getting some lighter games, namely Cosmic Frog which I just cant find anywhere, and perhaps Brian Boru, which seems to be quite fast, light and yet deep and replayable.

boardgames,Games with “texty” Cards/Tokens,False,5,0,"Over the years, I’ve realized that I tend not to prefer games with dozens of unique “texty” cards ie: cards with loads of text describing Actions or Events or some other game outcome. 


eg: a card called “**Iron Shepard**” that lets you Take 2 coins for every sheep on your board. Exception: if any other player has a *black* sheep, then this card has no effect. Compensate that player with 2 sausages unless they *also* hold the **Jade Grill** card in which case, give them 3 sausages and set **Threat Level** to ***obsidian***. 


It feels like these cards/games have drawn a lot of inspiration from Magic The Gathering (something which I personally never got into) and maybe that’s the appeal? I acknowledge that having such cards makes a game vastly replayable (“ah, I didn’t see this Hatchet card on my last play, but here it is now. Time to kill some sheep!!”) but I find that they make games so random and inelegant that I just can’t get into it. 

To cite specific examples: I enjoy Marvel United where the cards are just combinations of 3 symbols (with only a few “texty” cards) but I don’t enjoy Marvel Champions with its 100 unique texty cards.

boardgames,Gaming Living Room [COMC],False,167,0,"Hi all,

My wife and I are finally ready to show off our Gaming Living Room and our collection.

First; the pictures!

https://preview.redd.it/ogofxoesgxo91.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5376b92fb70aa7b81cae8e9dba6c115e0b880011

https://imgur.com/a/YdhmGlP

&amp;#x200B;

I've been board/analog gaming for a majority of my life, but it was mostly Monopoly and Pinochle with my family, and then some Magic: the Gathering and various other CCG's in the 90s. I didn't really get introduced into modern board gaming until the mid '00's when my best friend started having us play board games over lunch. Stone Age, to Agricola, to Power Grid... a bunch of classics of that time period.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really have need to buy anything at that time, because my best friend was a massive collector and did all the buying for us! Except... he moved away eventually. Then it turned into a yearly 'retreat' where a bunch of us, instead of going to GenCon to play games, would just go to one of our houses and play games. We rotate the hosting duties every year, and have about 4 different homes that we go to. We tend to fly in Wed-Sun once a year, only skipping 2020 for obvious reasons. We've done this now for over a decade. For years, this was mostly how/when I analog gamed - spending a bunch of my gaming time in video games. Occasionally I'd get a game out with a friend here or there, as it was more than a passing interest of mine given the yearly sojourn.

&amp;#x200B;

Then in 2019, I picked up Legendary Marvel on a lark with my wife at the FLGS, and she showed more than a passing interest in it. We then proceeded to play the every lovin' crap out of it through '19. Given that I might have a board gaming partner at home, maybe we should go to the FLGS a bit more!

&amp;#x200B;

Which led us to picking up Pandemic Legacy in Jan '20 (the timing? right?). My wife and I proceeded to play through for the next few months, deciding to ironically finish the last two months once the pandemic hit. The pandemic hitting was also reason enough for me to pick up Gloomhaven and my wife and I destroyed that game in lockdown and that was the beginning of me officially becoming a collector.

So from a collection standpoint, this really started in 2020, and while that might not be super interesting to some... there's some random old games in my closet of shame, and really the super star here is the dedication to craft that we've pursued here in the custom work we've had done to celebrate and show off our hobby.

&amp;#x200B;

What would I change about my collection? I really initially bought for game types to make sure that I had choices for every group/option/play style. I would pass up some games if I already had a game of that type (although not always...). Really the biggest change needed is that I'm so much in the cult of the new and the kickstarter cycle that I'm sure there are games I would absolutely enjoy that are already out there and I just have missed the news/review/bgg cycle on them. I am a big table presence guy though, as I don't have a good mind's eye, and having mini's is actually really important to me (I was also a fairly big Warhammer Fantasy Table Top gamer with my best friend in the '00's, so I'm kind of used to that play experience).

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately though, this as become an amazing hobby in which all three of my boys have joined in. Sometime after we stopped campaign gaming, we brought in our boys slowly but surely (14, 12, and almost 9 now... we started two years ago). Ramping them up with complexity and really planning our weekends around what game we were going to play. We've even gone so far as to have played TI4 seven times as a family of 5. We tend to make it an Event Game and buying ""space food"" and just playing up the event more than the overall competitiveness. My eldest tends to compete hard with my wife and I, but the younger two are balls of chaos that cannot be ignored. The middle child is also deviously intelligent in some games now, and we cannot under estimate him.

So for that, I'm thankful. We have an adult couple that comes over once or twice a month, and we tend to get 2-5 games in a weekend (depending on the length of game).

&amp;#x200B;

Top Game:

**Cloudspire** \- This game doesn't get enough love and attention, and I know why. It's got a weird elevator pitch, and a difficult learning curve. But for head to head PvP, it's an amazing game and my wife and I wish we could get it to the table more. Unfortunately, we aren't really a fan of it at 3p or 4p counts, and my middle child LOVES it, so it's hard to play at anything other than 3 or 4p.. so we tend not to get it out as much as we want. However, if you are looking for a deeply strategic PvP game that has assymetrical factions with some progression mechanics... it doesn't get much better than this. And  honestly, most people love Cloudspire for the solo puzzle play. It feels like I'm a rare one that loves the PvP mode here more.

Game that gets played the most (and is probably #2):

**Ankh: Gods of Egypt** \- We just had our 13th play of this game this weekend as a family. It just works at all player counts, and not only works, is REALLY GOOD at all player counts. Yes, the merge mechanic is controversial, and yes merging with the almost 9 year old can put you in a bind... but the decision space is so wonderful. Also; we were lucky to play with the expansion on play 1, and I think that's mandatory. So anyone who reads any review on this game/plays this game w/o the expansion needs to throw it away. The priest/politic card mechanic opens up a very necessary avenue of play with the possibilities of 'take that' from the cards you pick up, not to mention the layers of depth provided by moving the Pharaoh around, or providing yet another reason to trigger/not trigger the control monuments event.

&amp;#x200B;

The one game type that we've definitely dove heavy into is Heavy Euros for sure. My wife and I really enjoy games above 3.5 weighting in BGG, even if it sometimes frustrates us during the learning curve of the game. **Barrage** was a big surprise for me, as we had picked that up even before the BGA adaptation and probably has been my biggest mover up my favorite list chart. I haven't taken the time to make a top 10 list recently, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't in there at this point, after initially not being super high (the power mechanics are a bit obtuse at first).

&amp;#x200B;

**Black Rose Wars** is our favorite family game that isn't a ""good"" game. The English translation is very flawed, and we have to do a bit of game design on the fly sometimes, but we always have a great time slinging spells and having traps bounce off protection spells, while summoning big beasts... it's just a blast for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Favorite game that you've never heard of: **Daimyo: Rebirth of an Empire**. I enjoy Japanese/Chinese culture/myths and so this was a low expectation early kickstarter pickup. It's kind of kitchen sink mechanics game like Lost Ruins of Arnak (some deck building, some set collection, some area control) with some Scythe like player board revealing. It's a silly theme and doesn't make it to the table often (there are better games for sure), but it's always a good time when it comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh right, the cabinets :) It was 18 months from contacting our first contractor until we got it fully installed. The first contractor sat on our deposit and did nothing for 9 months (I think he under bid us, and the wood+labor was going to be too much and just... wasn't professional enough to do anything but keep us hanging). When we finally switched to a new contractor, it took them about 6 months to get through their queue and build it. It was a 2.5 day install to get everything up once they did finally get to that point.

We wanted an art piece, and not just a bunch of Kallaxes, mostly because we decided that we were going to repurpose our family room as our gaming room. It's literally the first thing you see when you come into the house (unless you are family, which means you come through the garage, naturally). With the big picture window, we didn't want to eliminate any sight lines to our back yard (and the mountains you can see) from our dining room (off camera left) so we always wanted curves into the window and not straight lines. Which lead to the original concept.

The lighting and the wiring was big challenge for me, I've used WLED strips and Home Automation for a few years now, but this was going to be my biggest project yet, and I had done a lot of reading.. but converting that into something real was a big trial and error. There are over 2300 LEDs in the cabinet, with three different power supplies. I've learned a lot, and I'm still learning how to harden it and make it safer and more permanent. I've still got some jury rigged portions ;)

Anyways, thanks for reading!

boardgames,"Etiquette questions (three of them), opinions wanted.",False,64,0,"1. So a couple months ago I was trying to teach some family members a relatively easy game as games go (splendor) and I found it pretty challenging to keep them engaged during just the rules portion of the explanation. They repeatedly said things like ""there are soo many rules"" and ""holy crap this is complicated"". This then lead to distracted side conversations about other things, laughing at my difficulty with further breaking down the rules, and the game taking forever to get started. Anybody else had this happen? What did you to about it?

2. Somebody quits out of a game entirely; this particular instance was a bad timing issue. But another person I know occasionally seems to disengage with the game and visibly lose interest, putting less effort into their turns. This brings the whole vibe down and I feel it's super lame. Had this happen? How'd you handle it?

3. Why do people whip out their phones in between every single turn? Even for just a few seconds of scrolling. Then they inevitably are reminded that it's their turn and have to then think about what to do and hold up the flow of the game, leading to more phones coming out. Am I just an old codger in the making or is as annoying as I feel it is?

Apologies if this seems like a complaining post. Just looking for whatever input you can offer. Thanks!

boardgames,Re-laminating board game box,False,7,0,I had a game box that was put on a slightly tacky painted surface and when I pulled it up part of the box art delaminated from the substrate. There's basically a shallow bubble in the box art. No rips or anything else though but I think over time that fragile part might tear.  Anyone have a good way to re-attach it?

boardgames,"Board Game Table with ""End Turn"" Buttons",False,23,0,"Over the past 2 years of COVID lockdowns my friends and I started playing our board games online via Table Top Simulator. One thing I came to appreciate with TTS is the notification that alerts you when it's your turn and the first/current player indicators in the top right corner of the screen. This meant that no matter how distracted any player became we always knew whose turn it was.

Now that the world has (hopefully) returned to normal(ish) and we've returned to playing games in person, I've realized just how much I miss this feature of TTS. So, I built a real world equivalent using a custom built table, some arcade buttons, and a bunch of software.  I even went as far as to integrate it with my smart home so it sets the mood for each game. 

Check out my lengthy instructable for the build steps, an explanation of how it all works, and a ton of pictures. At the very end you'll find a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ix2rRgi96E&amp;ab_channel=MrSmartyPints) with a full demo of the table integrating with my smart home

boardgames,Has Agricola been surpassed yet for WP?,False,43,0,"I count myself amongst the many who would credit Agricola as THE origin of their love fest with this hobby. It was my introduction to worker placement. I started with the family side of the board, and eventually worked my way up to the occupations and improvements. I love everything this game has to offer, especially the feeding and need to diversify.

As a life-long learner, and find it hard to believe I have yet to encounter a game that does WP better than a game from 2008. Not for lack of trying though. I gave Viticulture a go, but found the visitor cards not only swingy, but the best strategy for winning. Barrage has come very close, but the WP aspect isn't as central to the game as Agricola's. Uwe's other designs such as Feast for Odin, Caverna, and Fields of Arle don't have the same bite and tension that Agricola has.

So I ask, is this as good as it gets, or does there exist a crunchy, tension-filled WP game out there that would satisfy the masochists of the hobby?",,125,,43,,public

The last three games I have bought have all been either missing something or have had damaged components. It seems that I should be able to sort everything with my local board game shop but it's still a bit of a bummer as I most likely have to wait weeks or months for the replacements to arrive. Also the amount of missing cards or damaged components has been minimal but I mean, if I buy a brand new game for full price I do want a brand new game.

My main question is what might be differences in the enjoyment of playing Pan am or 7 Wonders Duel? What about replayability?

From what I know both are economic strategy games. I love the concept of Pan am for its theme and I’ve read reviews lauding it for how balanced the game is (parks felt balanced too, we played it numerous times. and we loved the theme!)

Now for 7 Wonders I’m wondering if the number of cards that change per round mean more diversity in plays. Is it much more exhilarating to play than pan am? I’ve also heard there are some plays with 7 wonders duel that the player ends up taking turns just to prevent the other from winning, I’m not too sure my parent would enjoy minding another player’s cards often apart from their own.

But, I know 7 wonders duel is a lot like a staple for two-players.

All that to say, if you’ve played both games, I’m interested to see how you’d compare them!

##FAQ

**I live in Costa Rica/Canada/Ecuador/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now I cnat spel amymor!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on two ducks and a tube of lube, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

boardgames,Thoughts on roll and writes?,False,2,0,"Specifically flip and writes I think. I’m a big fan of cartographers and welcome to. Thinking of also getting long shot. 

What I enjoy about them is how adaptable they are and you can play with 1-12 relatively easily. This means it gets to hit the table all the time rather than a game like secret Hitler (which is amazing) but only gets to hit the table once every month rather than 3 times a week.

boardgames,Question for Dominion collectors: do you still play the game the more expansions you own?,False,14,0,"I was a huge dominion fan for several years and played often. For most of that time I cycled around two expansions: dark ages and intrigue. I got a lot of mileage out of those two expansions. Then I started ‘collecting’ dominion. I have almost all of the expansions to date now and have figured out a storage solution to house all of them (wooden artist box). At this point however, the game is so huge and heavy it sits around unplayed way more than it used to. I’ve played the game several times since where I mix in all the expansions, but the games aren’t as interesting to me. I feel like dominion works best when you’re only playing with one or two expansions at a time.

I’m just wondering for the folks who’ve ended up collecting all the expansions, do you still play dominion frequently? 

I recently got one of those quiver card carrying cases and I’m thinking of just using that to have two expansions out at anytime to play the game. There’s something about having all of the expansions that makes the game feel less inviting.",,8,,14,,public

The haunt began suddenly, and the specifics are unimportant. On my first turn, I moved to the traitor's location, rolled 8 dice to attack, and got 7 2s and a blank. Instant kill. The Dwarf looked around and said, ""Back to the tavern, ye laggards. Drinks are on you.""",,6,,30,innovation,public

If it counts as a battle then both players would receive a reputation tile.

It doesn't feel right but the rulebook says ' A battle takes place if a Sector is occupied by more than one opponent (player or non-player such as Ancients, Guardians, or the GCDS).'.

So what is the definition of occupy?  A ship or an influence disc?  If it is a ship then you need more than a single ship to have a battle.  If its just an influence disc then it counts as a battle as the sector is 'occupied' by more than one opponent.",,8,,4,,public

boardgames,Card games similar to Magic but last a lot longer?,False,54,0,"My wife and I recently got into Dice Throne and enjoyed it quite a bit. We start with 50-75 life (I think 50 is standard but we like longer games). Either way games with the randomness of dice and decesion making take at least a good 30 minutes. There's a ton of back and forth usually and it feels like a battle. That being said we have most of the characters and were craving something a bit more complex, a bit more variety so we looked into MTG.

Long story short I played Magic 20 years ago and playing competitive with my wife in DT we got interested in Magic. We got started decks, nothing crazy powerful. We are having some fun... but I don't recall the game being so 'quick'. I guess that is the idea, but even with a few decks we are getting bored. There's a little back and forth and again we are not optimized and learning but we've had a few games go into turn 10+ though it seems pointlesss since you end up with tons of land but not many or no cards left in your hand to actually play since the game went on too long, but that is 20% of games. Most games seem over by turn 6 or close too it.

Looking online it seems like most MTG games are shorter at least from stats I read. I dunno know to me 15 minutes into a game turn 6 or 7 is where I want the game to get interesting and not be ending. Now  I understand the quickier games are over for Magic the quicker you see the same stuff/cards/decks and the more you want to make them... but wee don't have to much interest in making 20 different decks to use together (I know some products make that easy).

I guess long story short the structure of MTG makes games feel over as soon as they get going. What other games offer something longer and more like a 'battle' between two people?

**Are there any games with similar card mechanics, enjoyable art, and variety where the game is meant to last 30 - 60 minutes and feel like two people are really 'battling'?**",,112,,54,,public

boardgames,Everdell rules questions I couldn't answer with the faq,False,5,0,"Hello. Played base Everdell for the first time. We missed that the discards are facedown, so undertaker was more value than it's supposed to be.

ANSWERED 
Question: Does Cemetery only reveal the top 4 cards of the discard, with the necessity that the sequence can never be disrupted? That is, if you discarded them, you need to remember what they were and when to pull the trigger? I would assume this is the case and that there's no shuffling/randomization baked into the action of the word ""reveal.""

ANSWERED 
Question 2: When changing seasons, it's unclear who goes first for the next season. The way we played, it was the player directly clockwise from whoever took the ""prepare"" action last. In this way, the player who took the most actions in later seasons must go last at a catch up mechanic. Is this how you play?

ANSWERED
Finally, the rulebook says players who have finished the game cannot receive resources. The FAQ also says players who have finished can still have their buildings used (eg post office). I guess this means that victory points do not count as resources, and the finished player still gets the point, yes?

Last thursday was my sixth time at the Essen Spiel con. Employing some of the gained experience (intended time of arrival, parking place, entrance, plan for the day), we managed to snatch everything on our wish list, which coincidentally overlaps a lot with the BGG hotness. I wanted to share some of my hot takes on these games with you after our first plays since.

Some general remarks:

\- I am a true euro gamer, some favorites include Feast for Odin, Brass, Concordia.

\- English is not my first language.

\- These are HOT TAKES, not reviews! All games may evolve at multiple plays, player counts, states of mind, etc.

**Maui**

We played this family weight tile-laying game with 2P at the convention and had high hopes due to the combination of publisher (Next Move Games), artist (Chris Quilliams) and designer team (known from Jaipur, Botanik and more). 

I'll cut to the chase, this play was a disappointment. The production is very average and some components are straight up bad for a retail price of 35 euros (I'm looking at you, flimsy single sheet cardboard boards). While the art is cute and mellow, it is also very repetitive. Finally, gameplay wise, it was fine. The core mechanism is choosing towels to make color matches, to advance on generic point tracks. There is some strategy involved in the 'direction' you want to move up and down the board as you can pick up little bonuses on the beach (again, pretty boring set collection). I found the little economic sand dollar mechanism mostly frustrating, and my overall feeling was that this game would get old very quickly. However, it plays in 15 to 20 minutes and there is a variant included which I have not played that might add some depth. Not for me, might be fun for families and kids.

**Heat: pedal to the metal**

Very anticipated game since we all like Flamme Rouge. Played this 4P at the hotel, just 1 race on the USA map without any of the modules. It played very snappy, and the race took us 30 minutes. First impressions are very good, and this is the game I have been thinking about the most since playing it. There is a cool game of chicken going on around the corner/slip stream mechanic, and the push your luck of boosting fits right in. However, I am happy that there are different modules included, since the base game is very.. basic. A little less going on than in base Flamme Rouge as you pilot 1 car instead of 2. The price is justified since the modules/content is plenty and production is top notch, in Days of Wonder fashion. Anyway, can't wait to play a championship with all modules next week!

**Astra**

Played this yesterday at home with 3P. Did not read into this game at all. I think it's Mindclashes first family weight game You fill in stars on different constellation cards in a communal tableau using dry erase markers, and the person who finishes a constellation gets to keep it and use the card for its special power and a set collection end game scoring. People who contributed get to choose a boon. When you run out of stardust which is used to mark off stars, you take a rest action. I found a part of the rest action very annoying, since you get to refresh your acquired and used cards, but only if the elements depicted match the one on the main bord. But you have no agency over the displayed element; it just rotates clockwise between 4 types, after every other rest action. 

Overall, it did not feel like there were many interesting choices to be made and I felt little enjoyment going through the motions. At least it didn't take long (30-45 minutes). Components are good, but I don't get why we have to dry-erase instead of just having player colored stardust to be placed on the cards. It's always a bit messy with dry-erase markers.

**The Great Split**

4P game at the hotel. This game is slick and stylish as heck, and pictures certainly don't do the foil / metallic elements and excellent recessed played boards justice. It is a pretty light game, I would say slightly above Ticket to Ride weight. Everything revolves around the titular I split/you choose mechanism, which fuels an array of goods/contract tracks. Every track has it's own way of scoring, and they are all interesting and viable. There is more player interaction than expected, as it is imperative to keep track of you neighboards when you decide how to make your own split, which you hand to the left, and the split you get to decide on, which you get from the right. After the first round this game played very snappy (&lt;45 minutes) and overall left a great impression on us all. With the setup and scoring variability included, I think this will be an excellent filler, and also a very interesting welcoming game for new players. The only problem that comes to mind is one similar to Puerto Rico; an experienced/good player receiving splits from a newbie/bad player will probably have an edge for the whole game, as you go clockwise for the whole game. However, for this weight and lenght this isn't a problem for me personally.

**King of Monster Island**

Co-op King of Tokyo / New York sounded like a recipe for succes for me - I like these games, but my wife strongly dislikes the negative interaction and player elimination. Played this at 2P (with wife) and had a blast. The production is amazing, with usual vibrant King of \*\*\* art, chunky dice, fun cards and now also a volcano dice tower! The easiest scenario (Crystal Dragon on easy side) was not much of a challenge, but the game totally delivers the King of \*\*\* experience in co-op mode, with wacky powers, unpredictable events and big turns that make you feel awesome. I did not have a light weight dice chucking 30-45 minutes co-op experience yet, and this fits that category perfectly.

**Flamecraft**

Cuteness overload, played with 4P at hotel. This was the last game we played that night, and were a bit tired, and it took us a bit longer than 60 minutes. First of all, the value of this game is INCREDIBLE (I am talking about the standard, non-deluxe 35 euro version). Amazing artwork, neoprene playmat, large high quality cards, screen printed player dragon meeples; just hold this game next to Maui, and you will scratch your head how they can have the same price tag. The game itself is a clever action selection / resource gathering / contract fullfillment game with fun positive player interaction, as shops get progressively better, and you get the feeling of building the city up together. One of the artisan dragons (which got played frequently) lets you gift resources to other players for points! There is also plenty of variability in shops, fancy dragons and helpers, so replay value seems good at first glance. Overall, loved it! A good vibes family-plus weight game. Might be troublesome for very analysis paralysis prone players, as there is a lot of different stuff to do, and the choices open up even more as the game progresses.

**Atiwa**

I am a BIG Uwe fan, and was super pumped for this one. To our surprise, Atiwa is pretty different to his other farming themed games; it certainly is not the next Agricola/Caverna. Tip for new players/teachers: include a dummy first round of the game, since I found it hard to wrap my head around the game flow after hearing the rules explanation. But, after the first round it all clicked. We finished it in 60 minutes at 2P.

This game has an intriguing ecosystem of animals, trees, fruit and fruit bats which ties in beautifully with the core worker placement mechanism. I like that you can't aquire more workers, like in Nusfjord and Ora et Labora you play with 3 each round of the game (because in Uwe games that let you get more workers, it usually is the easiest path to victory). The art and production are fine and what you expect from Lookout. Concluding, I enjoyed the first play very much. However, I am worried whether this game has legs so to speak. There are limited ways to earn victory points and the breeding mechanism is dictated by the same prerequisites each round. It feels very inefficient to not work towards these prerequisites, as it literally gives you free stuff, and the amount of actions you can take is limited (to 3 workers time 7 rounds). We will see.

**Lacrimosa**

Maybe THE hottest Essen Spiel 2022 game? The queue for Devir was the longest one for sure :). Played two times already, at 2P and 3P. Long story short, it lives up to the hype. A very expensive game at 70 euros, but even the box in shrink screamed 'premium', and after opening it I think the price is justified. Stunning artwork, way better in person than on pictures, and every component is top-notch and designed with a purpose.

I will not delve into the mechanisms as Candice Harris wrote a wonderful in depth preview on BGG which I highly recommend: [https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/136882/spiel-22-preview-finish-mozarts-requiem-lacrimosa](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/136882/spiel-22-preview-finish-mozarts-requiem-lacrimosa)

We all loved it. The game is heavy, but plays very smoothly and is laid out intuitively. All necessary information can be found on the board / components, and ultimately every turns boils down to picking 1 card for it's action and 1 for it's income from a selection of 4. There is subtle interaction in all sections of the board; memory cards and opus cards you eyeball/work towards might get snatched, the travel mechanism uses a shared pawn which means locations you want to visit might get snatched or you move further away from them, and the masterpiece commissions are an area control game between 2 composers you can support. At 2, the game was pretty mellow and a bit more loose, but at 3 there was already plenty of competition for the best cards/spots/commissions. I imagine that the 4P game can get cutthroat and you have to pivot your plans even more often. Out of all games played, this one impressed me the most, and I look forward to explore it further at all player counts and solo.

**Crossing Oceans - sorry, this is a bit of a rant**

Last and sadly least, my biggest disappointment of this Spiel. Concordia is a 10/10 game for me and I cherish my copy, singed by Mac Gerdts himself, blinged out with all expansions, maps and insert. This game.. is not that. I bought Transatlantic the year it released and thought it was fine. I sold it after a couple of plays as Concordia gave me a similar experience, but better. This game was supposed to be Transatlantic 2. I have to report that this is not even a 1.5 version, and in my opinion a huge step backwards. I seriously wonder why and how 5 years of development were necessary to arrive at this stripped down, worse Transatlantic. Played at home at 2P.

More than 75% of the components are literally Transatlantic components. There is also an upgrade pack available to convert your game to Crossing Oceans, point for PD Verlag for that. The components, and the artwork (I think only the main board has artwork that is new compared to Transatlantic), are servicable. I hate the paper money.

The game removes the Concordia-like cardplay and replaces it with a rondel. A very BORING rondel. In the process, like half of the actions from Transatlantic got removed, and certainly the more interesting actions. Furthermore, you can't see what the actions do anywhere? There were player aids mentioned in the rulebook, but they are not listed on the components list, and are most certainly not included in the box. Very bad decision, as now the rulebook has to be kept at hand for at least a couple of rounds of the game.

Furthermore, not only actions got cut, but also scoring opportunities. You just score for money, pieces on the board, and a set collection mechanism of boats multiplied by 5 tracks on the player board. No more scoring for rows, no more scoring during the game.

The result of all this? A game that is boring, has a clear 'best action' each round, and kind of plays itself. I have 3 green boats, what do I do? I max the green tradehouses. I have maxed out my green tradehouses, what do I do? I buy as many green/wild boats/docks as possible since they score 10 points each. Now I have no money, so I play the actions that earns me the most money. Rinse and repeat. I never felt smart playing this game and was done halfway, but, it dragged on (about 90 minutes). Oh, and to make matters worse, the weirdest end game mechanism makes the game drag on even LONGER! After the deck runs out all players have not one, but 3 more actions to go through. Never again.

Mac, I hope you can now let the steam boat theme go, and focus on something new..

##FAQ

**I live in Peru/Canada/Jamaica/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the fundamental democratic values of my county are falling apart!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on this growing new thing called LSD, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

Upon doing a little research I found that these two people filed hundreds of cases against game stores  and companies nationwide.

Anthony Toro and Jasmine Toro are the two parties involved in the filings.

So far they've sued Crafty Games of Washington, Games of Berkeley in California, Black Rowan Games in Tracy, California, GMT Games in Hanford, California,  GameScape North in San Rafael, California, GameKastle and more.

They're not really looking to see if these sites are compliant, they're simply sending out demands for settlement.  Regardless, if you own a game store, or know of one, let them know to get their site tested immediately for ADA compliance, hire a company to handle the lawsuit when/if it comes, or simplify their site in such a way as to make it ADA compliant.

We're losing our gaming spaces and friends in the community to these trolls.  These people have no intentions of making the world better for disabled people, they're only looking to make money.

boardgames,WSBG Vegas 2022 Review or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Fact that Nobody Knows WTF is Going On,False,230,0,"a short (?), sweet (??), and scathing (!!!) review of my experience in Vegas...

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday: there are two Ring Events this night, 7 Wonders and Splendor; so far, so good, everything seems fairly well-conducted. I check in at the desk at the front of the Tournament Hall and I am given my table and my seat number, all is well and the night proceeds...

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday: my Ring Event this day is Wingspan, 9a start time - I check in at the front desk and I am given my table and my seat number. The ""player board"" tournament template that was introduced by the WSBG organizers started to be exercised, and it gave me some measure of confidence in their interest in conducting a fair and structured event. However, I noted at this time that there was no common game clock: games started when they were ready, and neither judges nor tournament procedures were ever introduced. When we needed assistance it was necessary for somebody from our table to get up and seek out somebody that looked like they might be a ""judge"" (???). Surprisingly, during our first game we were told by somebody who looked like a judge that we had \*\* 4 hours \*\* to complete the first round -&gt; this loose time control will come in to play again later in this review...

&amp;#x200B;

Friday (the cracks begin to show): As I did for the previous two events, I went to the front desk to check in. Somebody who ""looked like a judge"" (recall nobody has ever been formally introduced, they can only be recognized by standing in the right place at the right time wearing what looks like the right shirt) told me to ""go to the back corner of the hall"" for my game. I did so, and then somebody else wearing the right shirt asked me ""did you check in?"" -&gt; to which of course I responded ""no, I was told to come over here"". He then told me to go back to the front desk and check in... so back to the front desk I went, where I was admonished, yelled at and asked ""who told you to come up here? go back to the corner!"" -&gt; ???. I return to the back corner of the hall, somebody new wearing the right shirt shows up and tells everybody to find their name and seat number on a placard on one of the 7 tables and prepare for their game. After everybody finds their seat there are over a dozen players still milling about, confused that they have not been seated. The tournament organizer (?) that I previously mentioned starts reading names, covering all of the players who have not yet been seated, and tells them to step aside and be seated at another group of tables. Then, we are instructed to begin our round when we are ready. It seems like a rather small field, and then we come to find out: of the \~40 players that signed up for the event, for some reason \*\* 13 \*\* players were given a first round bye!! What was supposed to be a 4 round Ring Event (where the winner advances to Sunday's semifinals) was now at best a 3 round event where 1/3 of the field was given a first round bye...

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday, the final day of Ring Events: Dune Imperium

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;&lt; the degraded experience as the days went by prepared me for the s#!t show that was to come, and I was not disappointed &gt;&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Dune: Imperium -&gt; a sold out event (1 of maybe 2?) and arguably the crown jewel of the tournament given the game's popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

The first round was scheduled to start at 3p (already rescheduled twice) and when I arrived to check in I found the doors to the tournament hall closed. I opened the door and walked to the check-in desk.

&amp;#x200B;

“What game are you here for?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Dune”

&amp;#x200B;

“Game start has been delayed, please wait outside the hall and we’ll call you in when we’re ready for you”

&amp;#x200B;

...a sign on the door would have been helpful, but instead they had to make this same statement to at least 30 other people that opened the doors and went inside over the next 45 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

\~45 minutes later somebody wearing what looks like the right shirt comes out and instructs us to start lining up for check-in, again this game is sold out so we’ve got 256 players to get seated at 64 tables.

&amp;#x200B;

Check-in is complete, everybody is seated, but nobody has come around to instruct us how to proceed. After a few more minutes my table decides to reach out to the table next to us and swap game copies with them so we can start getting set up (recall: everybody had to bring their own copy of the game for the Ring Events that they signed up for, and you couldn’t play with your own copy so swapping like this is how it usually went; also note that fewer than half of the players at my tables actually brought copies of the game, so who exactly were these instructions for??).

&amp;#x200B;

My table is all set up, we're chatting, I have a good group of players and I’m feeling like this is going to be an enjoyable session... some more time passes and it looks like literally nobody is in control, besides being given table and seat numbers at check-in we have not received any instruction, so I get up to go find somebody who looks like they are wearing the right shirt to ask when we are starting the round and was told “oh, if you’re ready start now” grrrrr... so we did.

&amp;#x200B;

As the first round of the game starts we are all being very deliberate and taking our time, making sure that we all understand the ""player board"" template rules and deciding upon the conventions we want to establish for ""pieces played / cards laid"" etc. -- During this round a player at our table brings up a rules question and offers what they think the answer is; I agree and I am ready to continue the game, esp. as the question has nothing to do with anything currently happening on the board and was more “what if” based, but 2 other players didn’t agree with the interpretation and wanted a judge ruling at that moment. So our table calls for a judge, one comes over and discusses the rules and chats about where to find a valid ruling as they search through print-outs (rule book vs. published errata vs. BGG Dennen posts etc.) and just generally wastes time that didn’t need to be used at the moment, but whatever... 25 minutes or so go by and we get back to the game and we finish the first round of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

We start the second round of the game and another rules question comes up re: “are discard piles open information?”. I answer “yes of course they are”, a player at our table disagrees and wants a ruling, and this one I’m happy to get officially resolved since it should be quick \*\*and\*\* I know I’m right \*\*and\*\* I intend on using this during the game. A judge comes over and tells us “no, discard piles are not open information” ?!!?. I ask for them to bring another judge over, and after some rule book and errata investigation (along with more unnecessary casual chatting) the second judge decided to rule that “you can look through your own discard pile but not your opponent’s”, arghhhhhh !!!! To which I replied “if that is the ruling that you’re going to hold us to you are going to have a room full of very upset players, because every other player here knows that discard piles are absolutely open information” - but that was that, the ruling was made and we continued our game (another 20+ minutes spent on this unsatisfactorily resolved matter).

&amp;#x200B;

\^ not 10 minutes later I overhear the same question come up at a table in the next row, somebody who looks like a judge appears and immediately rules for that table that “yes, discard piles are open information”... so I guess there’s just different rules at each table ??

&amp;#x200B;

My table begins the third round of the game (for those unfamiliar, this game usually runs 8-9 rounds of play), we are finally looking like all of the B.S. might be behind us and we can get on with playing the game - halfway through the round one of the judges (the same from our first “rules question”) comes over to say “you have less than 40 minutes to finish your game” —— WAT

&amp;#x200B;

“the round ends @ 5:30”

&amp;#x200B;

How can that be, I ask? The round started late, and in fact every table started at different times since nobody told us when to start or what the time controls would be (recall we had 4 HOURS for our 1st round of Wingspan, so it never crossed my mind that time would be an issue here) - in addition, at least 45 minutes of our game time thus far had been wasted by judges who didn’t know what they were doing and seemingly had no problem taking their time and chatting us up using our game time !!

&amp;#x200B;

But that was it, the game ends at 5:30, finish it up - so then everybody at the table tilts, players at my table start yelling at each other, everybody rushing for whatever scraps of points they can get before time runs out, misplays abound (myself included), it becomes a giant clusterF..

&amp;#x200B;

My table is at the beginning of round 7 of the game when the same judge comes by again to tell us “game ends in 10 minutes, at that time finish the round and declare a winner” - at least that’s what I heard, 2 other players at our table heard “game ends in 10 minutes, finish THIS round and declare a winner” which makes considerably less sense, why bother telling us how much time is left if we’re just supposed to finish the current round? So this needed another judge ruling / clarification (and this one was actually necessary, since this absolutely impacts play for the next set of turns) - a few more minutes are wasted, the judge that comes over can’t give us a decisive answer (??) so says “I will go get an answer for you, I’ll be right back” — which doesn’t really help...

&amp;#x200B;

Half of the players at our table want to continue the game in the meantime, certain that this was indeed the last round and playing for the points to make sure they can secure the lead until the end of the round; myself and another player believe we can finish this round and get to the next one before time is called, and of course we both want that ruling as it puts us in the position we want to be in... but in truth nobody knows for sure what is going on at this point, everything is FUBAR

&amp;#x200B;

The round ends, everybody has exhausted their resources / screwed up their plays / tried to position themselves to reach a win condition at the time that they \_believed\_ the game would end.

&amp;#x200B;

The judge comes back and says “don’t worry about the time, just finish the game to completion”.

&amp;#x200B;

...and all hell breaks loose, my table is about to be flipped, \_nobody\_ is happy about this, none of us have reserved the resources or the play options to successfully plan to play this out.

&amp;#x200B;

Each player in our game was convinced they would have won in a different round given a different ruling on when the game was supposed to end...

&amp;#x200B;

Time to breathe, reliving this as I typed it out was fairly traumatic... there is no world in which I would ever do this again with these rank amateurs, this event was so poorly conducted, I feel incredibly duped; they were in no way prepared to succeed at a venture at this scale, despite marketing themselves as if they were; the resources exist in the gaming community that would have made them successful, I do not understand why they did not take advantage of them.

They were plastic and the ""standard"" pieces were Grey while the ""special"" harder pieces were yellow. They were also deceptively weighted/balanced; for example a piece might look like a cone but on closer inspection has uneven angles or is heavier weighted on one side than the other.

Shapes ranged from an egg, to a goblet, to a cone, to some funky cubes/rectangles.

boardgames,September victory - Pandemic Legacy Season 1,False,9,0,"&gt;!\[edit\] Adding another spoiler warning in case it shows up for some reason in previews as it did for at least one person.!&lt;

&gt;!Text follows.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Start:!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!After a BRUTAL first game in September where our Soldier was revealed to be the traitor and we flamed out spectacularly we picked ourselves up and tried again.  New member of the team - Anita the virologist who loathes the scientist, Fiona.  (Rivals)!&lt;

&gt;!We had an absolutely incredible start.  The one disease we'd fully 'upgraded', black, was not placed at all during the setup infection phase and we had sufficient black cards by turn 2 (scientist) to automatically cure it.  (She needs one fewer, the disease requires one fewer, and no action needed so when she drew her cards and got a third black on top of the two she had to start, it was done.) Amazing.!&lt;

&gt;!But then:  on turns 5, 9 and 13 the first player drew an epidemic card!  We were furiously trying to quarantine and/or remove faded figures - nearly the whole board has faded cities now - and just barely keeping it at bay.!&lt;

&gt;!Eventually we cure yellow, and get enough cards to the scientist - 4 - to cure red, but that's her final action so we have to survive one more go-round.  We've already sabotaged two bases, so all that's left is quarantining 7 cities, so that (plus preventing outbreaks) is our focus now.!&lt;

&gt;!With only I think five cards remaining we finally pull one of our funded events - we used two thanks to losing the previous match - and it was the one permitting the addition of two quarantine markers anywhere.  Incredible timing.!&lt;

&gt;!With that we just barely managed to get to the Scientist, luckily didn't get the fifth epidemic, and win.!&lt;

&gt;!Following the match we have: !&lt;

&gt;!18 cities stable 13 cities unstable 10 cities rioting 3 cities collapsing 4 cities fallen!&lt;

&gt;!Every continent has at least one Faded city except Asia. South America is in the best shape overall (no unstable cities, one faded).   We have no structures in North America any more; Europe has a few but is completely Faded, being the home of city zero (Essen).!&lt;

&gt;!Peeked ahead at October: looks like we're on the hunt for patient zero!  Thinking we need the operations specialist as we've lost a lot of structures to our own sabotage and of course rioters tearing down research labs!!&lt;

&gt;!Such a great game.  We're loving it.    Thirteen games over seven months to get to this point.!&lt;

&gt;!One thing I have found really interesting is that we are 50/50 win-loss with zero funded events in the deck.  Except our first game that we completely screwed up, we are 100% wins with any funded events in the deck.!&lt;

boardgames,WILDTAILS (Legacy Tails of Baritaria) Review - Buttonshy Legacy Card Game!!,False,3,0,"(Full video review here: https://youtu.be/h4y_3FkUXh8)

Ahoy there folks! For this week's video, I thought I'd break the trend with something a little more unscripted, a little more what's happening now. As such I'm going to be talking to you all about WILDTAILS - A Pirate Legacy; a pirate themed legacy resource management game for 1-2 players from Buttonshy games.

First of all, let me introduce you to Buttonshy games, if you don't already know about them. These guys make fantastic games using only eighteen cards, that come in these dinky little wallets, much like the ones you'd use for your train pass. We already have Skulls of Sedlec and Sprawlopolis, which I'll cover in future videos.

So what makes WILDTAILS so special? Well, firstly, it's a pirate game, and if you watched my review of LOOT, you'll know how I feel about pirate games.

Secondly, it's a Legacy game. No really. It's a Legacy Game, with only eighteen cards.

For those of you who don't know, Legacy games, like Pandemic Legacy or Risk Legacy, are games that evolve and change from round to round permanently altering the game. Depending on how you do, you may permanently modify the board, add new rules or cards, or even remove and destroy cards entirely. This means your next game session is going to be different and it feels like the game is evolving around you.

But again, to be able to do this kind of experience with only eighteen cards sounded frankly ludicrous. When I first heard about it through a friend on the boardgames Subreddit, I was a little dubious. Kind of like a treasure map found in a random bottle floating by. I contacted the guys at Buttonshy, and I've been beta testing the game for a week or so now and it REALLY holds up.

The basic premise of WILDTAILS is that you're aiming to build your own pirate empire in the semi-fictional American south following a story campaign of ten chapters.

The decisions you make throughout the campaign do affect the outcome, and also modify which new rules unlock on certain cards. As the campaign progresses, you'll unlock new abilities for your pirates, enhance your empire and even unlock a fleet fairly early on. You'll also get to choose new abilities for the characters as the game progresses and, without spoiling anything, the decisions you make can, and will make certain chapters more or less difficult.

So how does it actually play?

Basic gameplay involves you attempting to complete two objectives, before driving off that scenarios Threat, which could be Raiders, or even the bloody British Navy. You do this by taking actions each turn to complete scenes, attack the threat to keep it under control, or using character abilities and honestly, the way this all works is a little ingenious.

Besides the playable characters, the Empire card, and the reference card, every card in the game is having an identity crisis and is a Scene on one side of it, and then either an Objective or a Threat on the other. These cards also have FOUR different resources around the edges.

One of the most common actions you'll do on your turn is to interact with the current Scene card, completing one of the four tasks shown on it, hiring crew, pillaging the governor's manor, or... Robbing graves???

One of these tasks is usually free. Two have costs involved to achieve them, and the fourth usually involves a skill check to complete. When you complete a task on a Scene, you find which of the four edges shows the resources rewarded, and slip it under your character.

Cool, right? I love how they've managed to get so much done with so few cards!

In future turns, these resources can be used to pay for other tasks, or for interacting with various special abilities.

To make a skill check, you first reference the relevant ability on your character sheet, then reveal the scene below the current Scene for its modifier. You add this modifier to your character ability and if it matches or exceeds the requirement, the check was successful. Huzzah, pop open the rum, you're awesome.

Special note should be made that if the two Scenes ""Curse"" symbols match, it's an automatic failure, which adds a little tension even on easier checks, which I really like, even if it has dashed some of my best laid plans against the rocks of inadequacy.

If you fail a Skill Check, the scene is discarded, if you succeed, you earn the rewards.

At the end of each of your turns, you can also store cards under your empire card for other characters to hopefully use, thanks to the Smuggle action.

The second most common action is completing objectives. To complete a scenario, you must complete both objectives fully, then chase away the Threat.

To complete an objective, you must pay resources matching it's completion criteria. The first time this happens, you'll slide the objective under your character where it now provides permanent abilities and modifiers. As you complete the objective again and again, these cards slide up giving further rewards and abilities.

Again, how cool is this? This card was a Scene, four different resources, and an Objective, now it's a tracker giving you additional stuff each turn!

You'll ultimately need to complete each objective four times to get the final ability to line up so that you can finally chase away the threat and complete the scenario.

That, in a nutshell, is the main gameplay loop, making decisions, gathering resources, and completing the two objectives before beating the Threat. But there are a number of rubs and twists to really spice things up, like a bar fight at Tortuga.

Firstly, the threats don't sit idly watching your game, waiting to be taken out. They are called THREATS, after all.

Once the Scene deck depletes the first time, you'll reshuffle the discard pile to make a new Scene deck, then the Threat will capture one of the scenes, making the Threat tougher to beat and thinning the Scene deck a little. Then the Threat advances, using the Pirate's Log reference card as a convenient marker.

Now, the Curse symbols on the scenes suddenly gain a new use. At the start of a turn, if the Scene's curse marker matches any of the Curse Markers lined up on the Pirate's Log, then the relevant Threat affect triggers. This can involve capturing more Scenes, losing resource cards and more. These effects can really throw a cutlass into the works.

The more resource cards you hold, or are captured by the Threat, the faster the rounds go and the quicker it all ramps up. The trick is to use your resources quickly and efficiently, and try to effectively manage the threat by attacking it.

If you ever run out of Scene cards, or if the Threat captures five cards, or if you reach the end of the seventh round, the game ends in a failure.

Attacking the threat is the third action you can do on your turn, and involves making a Skill Check against the threat, increasing the requirements based on the number of cards the threat has currently captured. Whether you fail or pass this skill check, the current Scene is discarded. If you do manage to succeed, however, you smack the Threat upside the face, or some other equally heroic action, and all the captured Scenes are discarded. The Threat remains, and doesn't decrease in any other way, but you have those all important Scene cards back in the game for future rounds, and the Threat is easier to beat in future.

If you've completed both your objectives and have those final symbols lined up, it now means the Threat can be permanently defeated. Succeeding now will chase the Threat away and win the game.

The way that the Threat escalates throughout the game by adding more and more troublesome curse abilities, by stealing cards out of the Scene deck to speed up rounds, and getting stronger the more it captures really adds a sense of growing tension to the game that I really wasn't expecting.

This results in some really unnerving situations where you feel like you're racing against the clock. Doing whatever you can to keep pushing your objectives, whilst juggling an ever growing Threat really ups the ante in ways I wasn't expecting, and knowing that winning or losing scenarios changes the course of the story made for a really fun experience.

Now, some cooperative games absolutely suck to lose. Whilst I'm a fan of the Dark Souls boardgame, spending half an hour to set up a game that you play for three hours then lose, feels awful, and honestly, it's a real hard sell to go again. WILDTAILS? Screw it. Resetting takes seconds, and each scenario takes around 10-15 minutes, give or take any action paralysis.

Ultimately, eventually you'll reach the end of the campaign victorious, add up your score based on how you did through the game's four Acts, and get a final score. And normally, that's where a Legacy game ends. The board has been mutilated, cards destroyed, stickers all over the shop, and that's the experience.

Not so with WILDTAILS!

Once the campaign is over, you can continue to use your upgraded cards in post campaign one-shot scenarios. This was something I wasn't expecting and are still really cool!

You play with two random objectives, and a random Threat, and this can make for some really interesting scenarios not seen in the campaign. Obviously, your characters are fully upgraded at this point, and there's no way to undo any of the decisions you made that altered the cards, but this just means your version of post-campaign WILDTAILS is going to be different to other folks.

I was worried that playing post-campaign with fully upgraded characters and randomised objectives and threats could make things really hit or miss, but whilst there are definitely easier and harder setups, none ever felt unfair, but none ever felt smooth sailing either.

And remember, this is a Buttonshy game. Most of their current games are around the $12 range, with cheaper print and play options. Honestly, I expect WILDTAILS to be slightly more expensive due to a few extra components - mainly the sticker sheets - but even then, the value is astonishing, and for something that fits in your wallet and can be played in a space less than a square foot, I wouldn't mind picking up a few copies to go through a few times with friends.

And if you're happy to print and play, well, you can just keep printing new sets.

As much as I loved going through Pandemic Legacy the first time, the price tag makes it less appealing for replays, and there's no way to really play it after the campaign concludes short of trying to peel off stickers and using Tipex to erase whatever you've written on the board. It's a large pricetag for a shared experience and whilst it's absolutely wonderful, it definitely feels more like a one and done.

WILDTAILS has that inbuilt post-campaign playability, and going through the campaign again is only a minor investment.

Now, I'm using a prototype print and play supplied by Buttonshy here, using greyscale artwork and some filler graphics. The finished product will be full colour, and printed on proper card stock as you'd expect.

But even in greyscale, the artwork is gorgeous. The Scenes are lively and detailed, and I absolutely adore the animorphic characters. Seriously, if there's anything I love more than pirates, its Saturday Morning Cartoon pirates. Being Jack Sparrow is cool, but being Jack The Sparrow is even cooler. At least to me.

Honestly, if I have any complaint against the prototype, it's that the rules can be a little confusing to get your rum addled head around at first. Understanding that cards essentially have two or three uses each is the first hurdle. It's a Scene card, unless it's being used as a Threat card or an Objective card, or maybe even a Resource Card.

But once you understand this, the game is quick to set up and play, as you'd expect from Buttonshy, and a great fun experience.

Honestly, my journey with WILDTAILS started with me dubious that a legacy game could be done with eighteen cards, let alone be fun, but Buttonshy have once again proved their game design chops and crafted something genuinely fun, unique, and astonishing.

When this one launches, to me, it'll be a no brainer to add to our crew of games. It's small, cheap, and endlessly replayable. Until then, I'll keep playing games with my prototype deck.

If you enjoy pirate themes, and tense resource management, this game could be for you. If you give it a try, let me know in the comments. Otherwise, happy sailing, and see you all next time!",,0,,3,,public

Spoilers follow!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**CAMPAIGN WITH WIFE:**
She played Daisy (cluer) and I played Roland (fighter). The first scenario went swimmingly, with our team netting 6 experience points each by the end. The second scenario was definitely a step-up in difficulty. We were only able to interrogate two cultists (almost a third) before midnight struck. We played the third scenario last night, and it was a disaster. I pulled both of Roland's weaknesses in the first few rounds, and then all of the leftover cultists showed up. The end boss arrived, and we had little chance of winning. I had Lita in my deck, but she was three cards from the bottom.

Not going to lie, it was pretty discouraging. If you don't throw Lita at the baddie, you have to whittle away at his 14 HP, all while trying to deal with his 6 evade, or you get slammed with 3 dam/hor *every round*.

**CAMPAIGN WITH BROTHER:** He plays Skids (fighter build) and I play Wendy. I play through the campaign with my wife first, so that we can experience the shocks and surprises of the story together. With my brother, our games are always better because I know what to expect. We wrecked the first scenario and interrogated 3 cultists (almost 4) in the second. We haven't played the third yet.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**CONCLUSION:** The third scenario wasn't just tough, it honestly seemed fairly impossible if you don't draw Lita early in the scenario. We were SO excited about the game and loved the first two scenarios, but that third one is so poorly balanced that it took the wind out of our sails. I'm really reconsidering spending the $70 for the Dunwich campaign, especially because I've heard from other posters that it's easy to get behind the first scenarios and crash and burn mid-campaign.

Full disclosure, I already bought the Dunwich Investigator box, but haven't looked through it yet because I wanted to try the core campaign with only core cards. So what are your thoughts? Is the Dunwich campaign less soul-crushing? Is it worth picking up?

boardgames,OutlandEntertainment Apex DBG,False,5,0,"Hey all - I saw inventory on the outlandentertainment site suggesting inventory was available for the Apex Collected Edition deck builder. 

I have wanted this forever and was excited to place my order.  I’m worried now that my PayPal order with them is sitting in purgatory until a reprint happens… maybe I was wrong in my interpretation that they had inventory as no shipping announcement or email followed… just kinda been quiet.

Has anyone recently ordered apex or worked with Outland / have any insight on the Apex CE status?

Thanks.",,2,,5,,public
