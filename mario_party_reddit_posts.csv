A) Next turn is P2, then P3, then P4, then P1, etc.


B) Next turn is P2. Then we continue with the original turn order P1, P2, P3, and P4.

MARIOPARTY,Did/Does Mario Party Superstars NEED more boards?,False,33,0,"EDIT: This post is not to argue that there shouldn't be more boards. Rather, it is trying to argue that the game has a ton of replay value regardless of the board count in my opinion.

First, I obviously want more boards and content. I was hoping for DLC to be announced during the Nintendo Direct. I know MK8D is getting DLC 5 years later but still.

But in all honesty, the game is still awesome. Nearly all of the minigames are really good, and there are plenty of them. I never played the original Mario Parties (that will change with NSO), but I know the minigame selection was a lot smaller in earlier titles.

And I do know Superstars has a low board count, but they are all a blast to play. They each feel different, and they look great too. I like that the MP1 boards feel different than the MP2/3 boards.

For example, Peach‚Äôs Birthday Cake feels a bit like Monopoly with the Piranha Plants stealing coins and stars. Horror Land meanwhile has a really fun day/night cycle that can impede progress. The strategy for each board is so different.

Minigames are different in the sense that once you have a strategy for a particular one, you don‚Äôt have to change your gameplay too much. The beauty is that there are so many minigames, which helps to create variety in every session. Nailing the minigame selection it arguably just as important as the boards.

Another board or two may have cemented Superstars as the very best in the series. I do wish there were more boards (at least match the average of 6). Despite that, I think Superstars is still a phenomenal Mario Party and has a ton of replay value.

I think the only time stars should be that cheap is in a Pagoda‚Äôs Peak situation where the price consistently changes and you can‚Äôt really plan for it.

So, I would either‚Ä¶

-Make it so Twila only sold stars for 20 or more coins, or‚Ä¶

-Have it where every time someone buys a star, the price changes so I can‚Äôt just loop around the circle with a golden mushroom and get 15 stars for less than a hundred coins (which I basically did last time I played), or‚Ä¶

-I make it so that you literally don‚Äôt know the price Twila is charging. Twila rolls a
dice every time someone shows up, and then you have to debate if you want to buy it now or risk coming back when it could be lower or higher. You could literally pass him twice on 1 turn and get two different prices because it changes every time.

The game was brutal but when I matured and returned to it, I found a game of strategy, skill, and substance. I try not to rank based on mini-game selection because each game has its good and bad minigames. This is strictly decided by Party Mode.

1) Mario Party 3

Mario Party 3 has the original rule set and feel of what Mario Party was created to be. More items, more chaos, and weirdly enough-more control over your destiny.

2) Mario Party 6

I'll put Mario Party 6 here because it differentiates itself from the GameCube games by creating a more competitive and strategic atmosphere. The Day n' Night (Kid Cudi) system allows for more strategy, and having an item shop to buy orbs gives players more control over what is happening. These elements are somewhat missing from other Gamecube parties. It's not my personal number 2, but its features cannot be overlooked.

3) Mario Party Superstars

Classic game with updated models, boards, and quality of life features. Had the potential to be number 1 but there isn't as much control over the outcome as in other games and not enough boards to keep the fun going. A safe and serviceable game.

4) Mario Party 2

Mario Party 2 cleans up what Mario Party 1 made a mess of. The minigames are better designed. Items were added in for the first time ever. This game has a ton of personality to it. While having a competitive environment, it removes some of the more brutal features from Mario Party 1. Maybe that's to its credit but it over-delivers everywhere else.

5) Mario Party 1

I know it sounds as if my bias is talking, but honestly, if it was, this game would be ranked number 1. This game is all about knowledge and skill (Okay maybe 90%). There are no items in the first installment but to make up for that, minigames are made to mean so much more. If a player loses a minigame, they are likely to lose coins. Coins don't come so easily in this game. If you have a fat stack, you've earned it. Some of the minigames are brutal, both in-game and on your palms, but the feeling you get from playing this game hasn't been replicated since. This game is not for the faint of heart or for fractured friendships.

6) Mario Party 7

This game is unique, it has very outward thinking boards and I think that it pulls them off well enough. The item variety is also great in this game. Though these things do somewhat work in its favor, it detracts from the classic Mario party game feel. Each board almost feels like an entirely different game, which works for some but not for others. A polarizing game for sure.

7) Mario Party 5

Mario Party 5 introduces orbs or capsules (whatever they call it) and on the surface they are interesting. You can place them on the board or use them directly. The issue with them is that they are given out at random. This makes the game more challenging to take control of. Some of the boards are okay but none of them really stand out to me. Where Mario Party 7 kindve over-delivered, I feel as if Mario party 5 delivered the package an hour late. You still got it but not how you expected it. I sometimes feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience and are watching the game make the plays for me. Mario Party 6 does everything this game does but better. Not the worst, not the best.

8) Mario Party 8\*\*\*\*

This is the game I'm least familiar with. I did play it originally back on the Wii but I was becoming a teenager at the time and so my interests lay elsewhere. Since it's the final game I haven't revisited, I'll put Mario Party 8 at the 8 spot. Could easily be ranked higher but there's not a chance that it ranks lower.

9) Super Mario Party

Smaller boards and less turns (default setting), it's supposed to be a 'quicker' Mario party game. Not the typical hour+ drawn out Party modes that we've come to expect. This makes it somewhat unique. Yet instead of being an adrenaline-inducing, sprint to the finish, action movie explosion, it feels like an empty soulless game. As if it's trying to kick you out of their hypothetical restaurant before it actually closes. The item selection is okay and the boards are (meh) *okay* but nothing wows me. There's nothing that this game's party mode does particularly well or better than its predecessors.

10)  Mario Party 4

This game is just bland. The item selection is horrible. The animations slow the game down considerably. The boards are average at best, and uninspired to say the least. While there is some strategy, it doesn't feel as intuitive. It's the first GameCube party, and the only GameCube title to have the classic n64 rules. Outside of that extremely niche reason, gameplay-wise, there's no reason to play this game over the ones above it.

11) Mario Party 9

Each character is in a cart along with one another as they go through each board together. Almost completely luck-based. Almost everything that made Mario Party enjoyable was taken away in this installment. Flip a coin, if it's heads, you just won the party mode.

12) Mario Party 10

Each character is in a cart along with one another as they go through each board togeth.... Wait, its basically the same game. Flip a coin, if its tails, you just won the party mode.",,7,,6,wario,public

Well, with the announcement of the N64 trilogy of Mario Party games coming to the NSO service soon, I feel that Superstars was a rather pointless game and a bit of a waste of money. Unless they add a few GameCube era boards or something, I wouldn't recommend anyone to purchase this game instead of getting the N64 NSO app. A much older game like Mario Party 2 has more replay value than it. 

Anyway, I'm excited to be able to play Mario Party 2 again. And to play Mario Party 3 for the first time. The first MP game not so much, since I think it's considerably infeiror to MP2, but it's logical for the service to have it, so...

MARIOPARTY,Mario Party Superstars DLC Idea (Quest-Mode),False,2,0,"Let's use one of the ideas from the GBA for a fun board gimmick.

As an added bonus, they remaster all the GBA minigames for solo mode, and then for Local/Online Multiplayer, you can either do Co-op Quest Mode, or Quest Survival, where you and your friends battle it out to see who can collect the most quests. The main cast of characters are available and many new quests along with the original. You do start at a specific area that is dedicated to each player. 

Bowser and his son are out to cause trouble basically, and you have to stop him and then beat Junior in his various minigames. These would be either special 1v1 style duel minigames, or special ""boss"" related minigames that feature Junior or him sending one of his hired minions to give you trouble. Toad is still a host, and once you defeat Junior and all his minions, you get to challenge Bowser. 

Bonus mode is an endless mode, where you goal is with some friends complete as many quests as possible. (Everyone is on their own vehicles - you can also customize it).

MARIOPARTY,My problems with MP Superstars,False,0,0,"**#1. Not enough maps**

This can easily be fixed by adding more maps. Simple, but still a problem.

**#2. Bowser**

Bowser was a terrible idea to begin with and they‚Äôre still utilizing him in Mario Party Superstars. Fix: Remove Bowser altogether. This includes, but isn‚Äôt limited to: Bowser spaces (star stealing is an awful mechanic), Bowser in Yoshi‚Äôs Tropical Island and Peach‚Äôs Birthday cake, and any Bowser-related minigames such as Bowser‚Äôs Big Blast. All Bowser was is rude and angry, and I would not miss him if he were to be removed from Mario Party altogether. 

**#3. Not enough unique spaces**

The map is LITTERED with traditional Blue/Red spaces (and Lucky Spaces in Horror Land). There needs to be more unique spaces! Maybe an unlucky space, where you spin the roulette wheel to lose some coins or get cursed or something? Maybe a ‚Äútake an extra turn‚Äù space?

**#4. Star stealing**

Star stealing is an absolutely AWFUL mechanic that needs a swift removal. Remove ANY form of star stealing/trading, including but not limited to: Bowser spaces \[already talked about in point 2\], Boos, Chance Time.

**#5. Golden Pipes**

The overpowered item that can be bought for the low, low price of 25 coins, which is a literal joke in 25/30-turn parties. It literally teleports you RIGHT BEHIND THE STAR, not after, but BEFORE YOU ROLL THE DICE, which means YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO GET THE STAR THE TURN YOU USE THE GOLDEN PIPE. This is ESPECIALLY annoying when you are one or two spots away from the star at the end of your turn, and then one of your opponents whips out a golden pipe and steals it from you.

MARIOPARTY,Bowser's Peculiar Peak (Island Tour) is the worst board in the franchise imo,False,0,0,"There's literally not 1 decision you can make on the board. Noo split paths, no items, and every board event is 100% random.  All you do is roll a dice and play minigames. 

And in Island Tour, 4/68 minigames are just Bowser's Big Blast. On average you play BBB every 17 turns. 

The Board Gimmick makes things worse unless it's just a 1v1 match. The point is that the furthest player from the end wins. Once you reach the end, you play a dice game and if you lose, the game ends.

If you don't come 1st in minigames, you get an extra dice block depending on how bad you did. However, if you roll double numbers, you don't move for the turn. 

This +  alot of spaces that make you go forward and back means you can get an undeserved win just because you so happened to be in the back when 4th ended the game. SO THE ONLY INTERACTIVE PART DOESNT EVEN MATTER SOMETIMES...

MARIOPARTY,Mario Party 4 Is A Bad Game,False,10,0,"The other day, I was at a retro game store, when I saw Mario Party 4 on a shelf with a case for $60. It seemed like a good deal, so I happily bought it, having heard about how supposedly great it was. Then, I played it with two of my family members, and the game just wasn't fun. We played ds and 6 in the past, and this game just felt worse than those two in (almost) every way. I'll break down my thoughts.

**Boards**

The first thing to think about was which board to choose. I just picked the default choice, Toad's Midway Madness. This board was just not fun. In a 15 turn game, ONE person got a single star. What? Afterwards, I, with my brother, tried out two more boards, thinking the first was just a fluke, but no. On one game we, again, only claimed one star, and on the other, nobody got a single star. This shows a clear design flaw with the boards of Party 4. Every board has some way of making it absolute pain to get to the star, the worst case being on Goomba's Greedy Gala, which has a point where you have a 50% chance to be sent to the beginning, as well as a roulette wheel dependent on either chance, or having a ton of coins. Toad's midway madness had those annoying rotating cup things that make half of the people have to go through the same area again, followed by the last person having to go through AGAIN. There are two of these things on the map by the way. Koopa's seaside Soiree wasn't as bad in this regard, but still has a 50% chance of just not going to the star. Also, the boards all feel the same with their aesthetic and layout.

**Items**

It was interesting to experience the original style system of items from Parties 2, 3, and 4, and I can't say that they were on the whole bad, but they were kind of limiting. There aren't that many as somebody who has come from 6, and the only items you can get for free on the boards are mini/mega mushrooms, which are terribly designed items. The Mega Mushroom is the substitute for the mushroom, and the mini is the substitute for the skeleton key, which leads to some problems. You can't get a higher dice roll without skipping the important board events and the star, and the mini mushroom justifies bad map design. You can only escape the bottom left section of Goomba's greedy gala by relying on the 50% you get sent back to the start, or by using a mini mushroom, given you have one. 

**Characters**

There's only eight, but that doesn't really matter, moving on.

**Spaces**

One welcome change coming from 6 is that battle spaces are on the board rather than being determined by RNG. Mege/Mini spaces are far too plentiful and ensure that the game is slow paced. There are no duel or DK spaces in this game, pretty lame. You also can't duel by landing on the same space as somebody else in the final five turns. The lottery is essentially useless, considering Nobody in the games I've played have won anything. Chance time, I mean the Reversal of Fortune, isn't terrible, but it takes too long and is more clunky than in other games. 

**Minigames (the one good thing)**

Ok, so the minigames are good, but not as good as some would have you believe, and maybe this is just me, but the game really didn't like giving me new minigames, rather, the same ones were picked over and over again. There also aren't that many minigames, only 60 compared to the 82 of 6 and 73 of ds. It is neat however how you can choose a list of minigames that pop up in party mode, meaning you don't have to play the ones you don't like. The absence of duel mimigames is also felt. I will say that the minigames on the whole are better than 6, but I prefer 6's lineup due to having more.

**Conclusion**

Mario Party 4 is conceptually flawed, with problems that have been avoided in earlier entries and later ones. Maybe with time I'll come around to this game, but for now, Mario Party 6 is my Mario Party of choice.",,25,,10,noflair,public

At the end of the turn, the bomb activates and turns Baby Bowser into Bowser and he rolls 3 dice from that spot and moves on the board, anyone he passes gets stonped and loses all their coins. 

I'd like to see the return of this mechanic but with some minor tweaks personally. 

- Originally the AI was pretty dumb and Bowser would take random paths sometimes missing an opportunity to crush players. The AI should be updated to go after the nearest player with coins. 

- Maybe not take all coins as that's a bit brutal and we have the Bowser laser for that lol. Maybe half is sufficient.

Nd Cube loves to make something new for Mario Party and it shows. While 10 isn't really new in the Car formula, Bowser Party did make the gameplay fresh enough for a good amount of people to enjoy.

I, for one, would be interested in a completely different Mario Party game. I had given the modern games a try at least twice and I have liked a good amount of them.

If I were to fix this, I would have it to the traditional way of players running around to collect a Star that's randomly placed on specific spaces. Keep the Chain Chomps the way they are and also give the option for players to also steal Coins if they're in the way and have no Stars. Maybe remove a few Chain Chomp Houses to make it more fair.

I like the minigames
The boss battles
And the title screen and superstar screen(but only for 9)

I slowly started to realize why this game and 10 are bad. I don‚Äôt hate the car mechanic but I hate it being the main mode, it can be a side mode though. 10 was even worse for me. Soon I got my first classic mario party for my 13th bday, mario party 8, despite this games issues I love it, if it had more time it‚Äôd be better.My experience got even better when I got MP DS, and in my mid teens Super which is ok and finally amazing with superstars. I‚Äôm glad I can experience some classic MP.  Haven‚Äôt touched 9 or 10 in like 4 years LMAO.

TLDR my mario party experience was a wild ride

3. We have a TV

4. I'm planning to buy a single joycon

1. If I were to buy a single joycon ( for clarification, I mean ""half"" controller ) does that mean 4 players can play ? I'm using my lite, 2 people using the 2 joycon from switch OLED, and 1 more using the newly bought single joycon

2. If I were to give my cartridge to my friend, then he docked it to the TV, can all 4 of us play on TV using a *single copy* of the physical game ? 

3. Can I play from my switch *lite* and control my character on the TV where the game is docked ? 

4. A bit out ofd topic but how would the save work, since I would sometime play alone on my lite, does that mean if I add my account we are playing on *my* save on *his* switch using cloud save ?

MARIOPARTY,My biggest issues with Superstars:,False,6,0,"Generally new to sub, so apologize if this is a repost: I like Mario Party Superstars overall but there are three things that piss me off about it. One is the amount of lucky spaces, which I‚Äôm sure is a typical complaint. Someone, in almost every single turn lands on one. It‚Äôs ridiculous. I remember when they were introduced in 8, they were actually Lucky but now it feels that they‚Äôre about as common as blue spaces. The second, is the objects available‚Äî I really hate the Golden Pipe and chain chomp call. Every single NPC buys the freaking chain chomp whistle. It devolves this game into a complete crap shoot of where the star is and at what time, and if it‚Äôs nowhere close to you there‚Äôs no need to worry because it‚Äôs just going to get whisked away the second anyone does. And then there‚Äôs the Golden Pipe. Same issue as the whistle, once it‚Äôs available in the second half, anyone with 25 coins will purchase it. And because of the scale of lucky spaces as previously mentioned just about everyone does at the halfway point. It makes the strategy/luck aspect so loose and makes it a competition of who can visit the store most. And my third and final complaint are coin minigames. They‚Äôre too common and so overpowered, in previous games there would be times where the whole game would pass and no coin mini game ever showed up but now you can end up playing 2-3 in longer games and exacerbate the ‚Äúeveryone is rich‚Äù issue.

But say it was added in for at least 1-2 boards. How would you balance it out?

I'd either go with giving it a very high cost (i.e. 15-20 coins) or make it so you cannot target yourself with it. I imagine the former would be preferable because most players didn't use the Reverse Mushroom on opponents except in very specific circumstances, and players would be rubbed the wrong way if they couldn't use it on themselves. Alternatively, if the cost were kept low, I'd have it so you would be limited to rolling a 1-5, reducing the amount of shenanigans you can pull off with it.",,17,,8,noflair,public

MARIOPARTY,Hope the next game goes back to the car.,False,0,0,"I can't with the way Mario Party is with the classic way. Everyone else likes to say I'm wrong or don't know anything about why the classic games are great, but I really can't get into them at all. And I am not sorry for defending the hell out of the non-traditional Mario Party games because even I say that no one understands them, yet I get a lot of hate from saying that.

First, I want to say that I am not a troll since some users here thinks I am. I grew up with classic Mario Party and I find them to be boring games; way too random and that things just sort of happen that feels like the game says ""fuck you"" to anyone. Yes, I know. ""Of course. That's how Mario Party has always been about."" Well, I find that to be bad game design and it still surprises me they were still making a new game on a yearly basis up to like 7 or whatever.

9 and 10 felt more safe and made much more sense. Everyone have a fair share of winning as there's less luck involved while I'm older and now the current games, a lot of the luck overweights the fun I have with the board designs. They're too random and they also drag too long since I have to wait for everyone, including myself to look at the map in the starting turn, the shop, or even choosing a path. Plus, Minigame after everyone's turn feels even more of a slog, as well as getting to events in boards that literally nothing happens other than having to watch animations play out before the game notices you don't have anything. It's all boring and I don't see why everyone says that there's more skill in those game than the non-traditional ones.

The car games were more faster, simple, doesn't waste anyone's time. A better skill of getting Ministars and try avoid the Mini Ztars as well. Captain Events and getting to Minigames if you want to or if the game decides. I order a quick game of Mario Party 10 as it only takes 30 minutes and it's plenty of time for me to enjoy and go for another round, felling more refreshing instead of waiting for the game to end already in the traditional ones.

I really want that car back. I felt that it really was the right direction of the series as they fixed my issues with them having dated gameplay for years and felt more aggravating than exciting.",,15,,0,noflair,public

MARIOPARTY,What boards do you want and think would be in a Gamecube DLC Pack/Superstar 2?,False,9,0,"Rules are simple. We‚Äôre pretending Mario Party Superstars 2 or a DLC pack will focus on the Gamecube games. You only get to pick 5 boards.

However, you‚Äôll make 2 lists. 
One of what boards you would WANT, and the other one is what boards you think would actually get picked
So, for Example‚Ä¶.

I would want‚Ä¶

1. Neon Heights

2. Pagoda‚Äôs Peak

3. Windmillville

4. Castaway Bay

5. Bowser‚Äôs Enchanted Inferno

Clearly MP7 is my absolute favorite of the group, but it‚Äôs what I want, not balance or logic lol


What I think we will get‚Ä¶

1. Sweet Dream

2. Bowser‚Äôs Nightmare

3. Toad‚Äôs Midway Madness

4. Castaway Bay

5. Pyramid Park

I think the second list is terrible, but I feel like this is a fairly accurate guess and here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶

I feel like they would give us 2 from Mario Party 5 for sure because it had the most boards AND is the favorite according to the poll on Superstars. Although, I could really see them going with almost any 2 from MP5, except Future Dream since they already remade a map in space, but I also feel like they would give us a Bowser Board for this round since so many people asked for it, and since MP5 gets 2 boards, that would likely be where the Bowser board comes from.
I feel like since they didn‚Äôt go with Mario‚Äôs Rainbow Castle in Superstars, they‚Äôll go with Castaway Bay since it‚Äôs the spiritual successor AND one of the few linear boards on the Gamecube.
Since they made three different versions of star stealing maps I feel like they would absolutely go with one of them, likely Pyramid Park since it was the newer and improved version and because we need a map from MP7. 
Then for an MP4 board they would probably go for Toad‚Äôs Midway Madness. This is the pick I‚Äôm least certain of because I could also see it being Shy Guy‚Äôs Jungle Jam, but all the other MP4 picks seem unlikely.

But this is just me and my opinion. I want to hear which 5 you WANT and what 5 you THINK they would do!",,17,,9,diddykong,public

MARIOPARTY,How I would make Mario Party Superstars 2,False,1,0,"Since we don't know whether the next Mario Party game will be a continuation of Superstars with Superstars 2 (Focusing on the end of the Hudson Soft Era) or something entirely new, I thought it would be fun to throw out suggestions in the case that Superstars 2 does get announced a couple of years down the road. While I won't go over Mini-Games in great detail I'll throw out some mini-games I'd like to see in Superstars 2 that isn't in Superstars. Without further ado, let's begin.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Mechanics**

Each of the Mario Party games after 3 have their own unique gimmick. As such each stage representative of each game will have the specific mechanic the game is from For example Mario Party 6's stage will have a Day/Night Cycle while Mario Party 7's stage will have Bowser Time, stuff like that. The first mechanic is something that is on Dolphin Emulator used for Gecko Codes and that's item deletion, this is a really good idea to get rid of items that you don't want to use at all and is a quality of life improvement, the more options the better.

Secondly, a short time ago there's been some hostile back and forth about the pacing of classic Mario Party. One of the things that was significant about Star Rush and The Top 100 was that everyone moved at the same time. This is a pretty decent idea and I don't see why this can't work in the classic formula and stage. Everyone can take their turn at the same time and run along the expansive board. The only potential problem of this is when it comes to items. A big part of the GameCube era Mario Parties was using items to set traps along the board. So what if someone tries to occupy the same space for a trap like the other player? Well like Star Rush and the Top 100 you can play a short Mini-Game to see who gets it. However, this will all be completely optional and can be changed in settings.

Lastly I want to address somethings regarding Mario Party's 4 and 5. I hate Mario Party 4's Mini &amp; Mega Mushroom system, however I won't throw the mechanic out all together. Instead we'll be making some minor changes to them to hopefully be less annoying. As far as Mario Party 5 the game controversially removed Item Shops in favor of dealing out random capsules, while this never really bothered me I definitely see how this is annoying. So the item shops will be back, but the Capsules aren't going to be thrown out. They will be exclusive to Mario Party 5's board and will still be available to grab alongside buying items from the shop. This the randomness isn't thrown out altogether but just toned down and with the item deletion feature, you won't have to worry about having too many items.

Playing on each board will of course reward you with points or currency. Which you can use to unlock features like additional music, figures which you can use iÃ∂nÃ∂ Ã∂sÃ∂oÃ∂mÃ∂eÃ∂tÃ∂hÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂gÃ∂ Ã∂wÃ∂eÃ∂'Ã∂lÃ∂lÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂aÃ∂lÃ∂kÃ∂ Ã∂aÃ∂bÃ∂oÃ∂uÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂lÃ∂aÃ∂tÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂, exclusive artwork, characters, and even a new board. Alright enough about the mechanics, talk about the people who'll be utilizing them

&amp;#x200B;

* **Roster**

Mario Party's Roster has gradually increased in size over the years so the game should have a pretty healthy roster so here are my picks for such.

Starting Roster: Mario (Duh), Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Wario, Waluigi, Yoshi, Toad, Toadette, and Koopa Kid

Unlockable: Birdo, Diddy Kong, Boo, Rosalina, and Paulene

And that does it for the Roster. So let's set these players on their playing fields.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Boards**

This should be the easiest one to cover so we'll tackle this first. Since Superstars has an emphasis on the N64 Trilogy, Superstars 2 will focus on the rest of the Hudson Soft Era. So in that case we'll be picking boards from each game. So let's start with Mario Party 4.

&amp;#x200B;

[My board pick from MP4: Shy Guy's Jungle](https://preview.redd.it/mf3j8gko4me91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=941ab05f17bd284caa700270f4ea27a180016622)

Mario Party 4 is a strong contender for the worst boards of the classic era, this could be in part to the fact that 2001 and 2002 was a transitional period from the N64 to the GameCube so they may not have known how to do it yet but still. So my board choice representing MP4 is Shy Guy's Jungle simply for being the least annoying board in the game. One thing we need to discuss is the Mini and Mega Mushroom system. The Mini Mushroom in the game allows someone to take alternate routes via pipes along the board at the cost of only rolling the numbers 1-5. As much as this system annoyed me, I don't wanna throw it out completely. So instead I would change it so that Mini Mushrooms can still roll 1-10 and take the pipes. Also the lottery system is gone completely, no one ever wins big in 2 of those events and it's kind of a waste of coins, plus it doesn't fit the jungle esthetic anyway, plus we'll be seeing it done better later. Anyway enough about this, lets move onto 5.

&amp;#x200B;

[My board pick from MP5: Sweet Dreams](https://preview.redd.it/gvd0tutl7me91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d791f406228e32f5124c7b539729692660ef435)

Mario Party 5 was pretty hard to choose from in terms of boards, Hudson Soft figured out how to make the boards weave around the environment, a vast improvement over 4. It was hard choice between this and Future Dream but ultimately decided on Sweet Dream due to seamless transitions to different areas of the board. As we discussed in Mechanics one of the things people didn't like about MP5 was the randomness of Capsules, and while the item shop is going to come back, capsules won't be thrown out all together. Instead you can still use and collect capsules as you travel along an expansive board. Item Shops will also allow you to buy more capsules (board exclusive) in the case that you need multiple copies of the same capsule in order to activate the effects, giving it some strategy without throwing out the randomness altogether. Now let's move onto MP6.

&amp;#x200B;

[My board pick from MP6: Fair Square](https://preview.redd.it/dpwhnvtrfme91.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=325509a3b652d302982c1b074a9f8e89d9dd503f)

Not really much needs to be said for this one. Since MP6 is Top 3 in terms of board quality only behind the next entry and maybe Mario Party 3. While I love Snowflake Lake and Castaway Bay, there really isn't a competition. Fair Square is a strong contender for the best board in the entire series. The Day/Night cycle will still work as usual and will be exclusive to this board. Honestly, nothing really needs to change here so we can move on.

&amp;#x200B;

[My board pick from MP7: Pyramid Park](https://preview.redd.it/6upwdvg79qe91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5af5e8840e42b293a5b72370c51f59efa8343eed)

Now we come to MP7, the game with the best boards in the series. This was easily the hardest choice since all of the boards here are great. I originally chose Neon Heights because it was my favorite when I first played, but after someone told me that would make 3 town themed boards, I realized that wouldn't be a very good variety wise, so I decided to change it to Pyramid Park. Like MP6 nothing really needs to change mechanic wise. Bowser Time will still be in effect for this board exclusively. With that we can move onto MP8.

&amp;#x200B;

[My board pick from MP8: Koopa's Tycoon Town](https://preview.redd.it/93i0zck1ime91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5535cb055d7c7d9bca3e8b28b844fa4d93b16aed)

Mario Party 8 along with 5 are easily the two most underrated games in the series. Mario Party 8's boards don't really get talked about much outside of this selection here, but most the boards in the game are pretty good. With this one I had a tough time deciding to between King Boo's Haunted Hideaway and this. However I chose Koopa's Tycoon Town because it provides a different gameplay experience. Instead of buying stars, you building's that are worth stars. You can protect it from being bought out by other players by investing coins. While Mario Party 7 did the concept first with Windmillville, I feel 8 did the idea better. One of only 2 instances where the Bowser Time mechanic hurt the experience rather then helped on top of this think a smaller board would work better for a style of play such as this. However I could alternate and put Windmillville as MP7's board representative and King Boo's Hideaway as 8's representative. So if I edited the post, just keep this in mind. The only thing I would change on this board is that it could be made to be a tiny bit larger and maybe put a few more happening spaces for other interesting events. You'll still be able to pick up random candies in addition to buying things from item shops.

&amp;#x200B;

[My board pick from MPDS: Kamek's Library](https://preview.redd.it/qa2vwcepkme91.png?width=458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faadba2720931b124e25bc0de5ca67b084f60ca5)

Some of you might be surprised by this, but I decided to include MP8 and DS, but they are the last two official classic Mario Party games so I decided to include them with the GameCube games. MPDS was the Final Game of the Hudson Soft era and what a fine title to go out on. I chose Kamek's Library as the stage to represent MP Ds for reasons I'll get into in just a bit. For this the players will be made small just like in the original game and will work the same way as the original. However the gimmick for this board will be the Boss Battle. Even before Island Tour and Star Rush, MPDS was technically the first MP game to introduce Boss Battles. Kamek's Boss Battle in the original is the best of the game which is why I chose it. So for this board, the game does not end when you tally the coins and stars. Instead similar to Island Tour and Star Rush there will be a boss battle with Kamek at the very end after your coins and stars are tallied. The boss battle will need to re-worked because of this, but it's possible. How this will work as to not make it unfair for people who didn't do well in regular board play, the start order when instead go from Last Place-First Place to give other players a chance of a comeback. The person who earns the most points in the Boss Battle will receive 3 additional bonus stars, as a chance to turn the tide in their favor.

&amp;#x200B;

[Unlockable Bonus Board: Bowsers Nightmare \(MP5\)](https://preview.redd.it/mxgv97jfnme91.png?width=932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1f03bc58bf7814888f5f966d9566c55c386b37e)

All of the Mario Party games after 3 have introduced a bowser board of sorts. So I decided to pick my favorite Bowser board, Bowser's Nightmare from Mario Party 5. To unlock, players will need to play the boards and side-content and spend points they earn to unlock it. The mechanics will work the same as the reworked MP5 Board I did with Sweet Dream.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Minigames**

Now we get the thing that goes with these boards, Minigames. While Superstars already has a lot of classics already in it and they will stay for Superstars 2. I'll just name a few Mini-Games from these MP's that I'd like to see in Superstars 2 that aren't already in Superstars.

MP4: Avalanche!, Mario Speedwagon, Three Throw, Long Claw of the Law, Fish n Drips, Hide and Go Boom, Team Treasure Trek, Pair a Sailing, The Great Deflate and Cliff Hangers

MP5: Hotel Gomba, Mazed &amp; Confused, Frozen Frenzy, Ground Pound Down, Chimp Chase, Chomp Romp, Revolving Fire, Defuse or Lose, Panic Pinball, ID UFO, and Mario Mechs

MP7: Take me ohm, Fun Run, Bubble Braw, Snow Run, Target Tag, La Bomba, Spinner Cell, Tile &amp; Error, Buzzstormer, Kart Wheeled, and Hop o Matic 4000

Bowser Minigames: Darts of Doom, Balloon of Doom, Rain of Fire, Scaldin Cauldron, Frightmare, Dark n Crispy, Dizzy Rotisserie, Magmical Journey, Funstacle Course, and Bowser's Block Party

&amp;#x200B;

* **Side Modes**

Now we've come to the final part of this. One of the things that made the GameCube era of Mario Party the best era (imo) is the amount of side content and additional modes that you can do. Originally when I created my tier list, I have since put Superstars at the bottom of the ""Amazing"" tier. I have since dropped it down to the top of ""Good"" Tier, and swapped it's place with Mario Party 4. Outside of the traditional party mode, the game doesn't really have much to offer in terms of side content. There is a traditional Mini-game mode in Mt Minigames, but it's pretty standard and doesn't set itself apart. So we're gonna stick some side-modes from the older games in here.

*Minigame Mode:*

Pretty standard as all Mario Party's have this however Mario Party's on the GameCube did some unique things with these Mini-Game Modes so here are some of them. I'd put in Superstars 2.

Free Play: Play any Mini-Games you want in whatever format. Free for All, 2v2, 1v3, Duel, Battle, DK, Bowser. All Mini-Games will be accessible for you to go back and play them.

Tic-Tac-Toe Mode (MP4)

Mini-Game Circuit (MP5)

Mini Game Tournament (MP5)

Flip Out Frenzy (MP8)

&amp;#x200B;

*Additional Bonus Game Modes:*

Super Duel Mode (MP5)

Puzzle Mode (MPDS)

Digital Figure Mode (Original): Pose purchased figures you've unlocked and pose them in different backgrounds and scenes.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Conclusion**

And that...is how I would make Mario Party Superstars 2. Did you enjoy it? Do you have any ideas? Definitely express comments down below. Please keep in mind that this is all just a fantasy creation, whether this will or won't happen is completely irrelevant. This was meant to be for fun and for discussion. Also do not bring in excuses like ""Oh all this can't be done. It would cost too much money"", again this is just a fantasy Wishlist for fun, and Nintendo is a trillion dollar company.

I‚Äôll admit, I used two early boo bell to stop two players from getting stars, and I threw another team game to stop my teammate from having enough money to get a star. 

However, these guys did the following:

1.	Daisy Stole my star (fair game) to gain the lead
2.	Donkey used a plunder chest on me as revenge. Spent 20 on the chest and stole my mushroom simply out of spite. A loss of 15 coins for him
3.	Donkey used another plunder chest on me to steal my double dice despite others having triple dice and me no longer being in the lead. That‚Äôs a net  coin loss of 8? just to spite me
4.	Wario specifically picked me and sent a boo for my coins despite me not having many at this point and others having more than me and others were closer to the star
5.	Donkey used another plunder chest on me to steal my golden pipe. I wasn‚Äôt the only player with a golden he could have taken it from. 
6.	Daisy deliberately lands on chance time with a custom dice and then proceeds to study the chance time slot to land on me specifically which results in all my coins being taken. 

At this point, I‚Äôm in last and these guys are using me as a punching bag, when it would have been better to focus on the guy with THREE STARS (Daisy) instead of the guy with ONE. 

If you‚Äôre going to use the entire game to get revenge on one character despite it not making strategic sense, then you ruin the entire game. 

I understand if you‚Äôre going to get revenge once if that person is in the lead, but If you‚Äôre sabotaging your own chances of winning for spite‚Ä¶. I mean, come on! 

Like, I have had friends in civilization 6 do that to me and it‚Äôs so petty. Spends the entire game at war with me, while our other friend runs away with the game.",,1,,1,noflair,public
MARIOPARTY,Was Mario Party 4 scrapped?,False,22,0,"Now... reading this, you might think I sound stupid, obviously no, it was scrapped, but that's the version we received. I believe the Mario Party 4 we received was not the first Mario Party 4. 

So, starting off, this isn't my initial idea, someone on Twitter pointed out the initial box art (pictured in comments). Now... I can admit that all of this evidence I provide is theoretically circumstantial, but like... just follow along with me.

Point 1

Mario Party 3 released December 7th, 2000 in Japan, Mario Party 4, released in North America first, on October 21, 2002. That is nearly a 2 year time difference during a time in the series when they were releasing annually, not to mention that it continued to  to be on a yearly basis after Mario Party 4 for a few entries. 
Mario Party 1 was released December 14, 1998 in Japan. Mario Party 2 released December 17, 1999 in Japan. 

Point 2

Mario Party 1 has 50 minigames, Mario Party 2 has 65, Mario Party 3 has a total of 71. By this measure, you would expect Mario Party 4 to have around 80 minigames, but no, there are only 60. The number reduces down to 43 if you don't include the minigames you don't encounter in a normal Party mode situation. Why so few minigames? Especially considering Mario Party 5 that released first in North America in November 10, 2003, has 75 minigames.

Point 3

The boards in Mario Party 4 are incredibly lack luster. The boards feel rushed, glossed over, and dull because of how they're all Grey boardwalks floating over a set. Like... Imagine Toad's Midway Madness actually as a real amusement park, with all the surroundings and board interactions. I mean, both Party 3 and Party 5 have way better boards than 4 and they had less time between releases.

Point 4

It's possible to believe that Mario Party 4 was going to be in the style of the classic art style. The initial box art clearly depicts all the characters in their classic form, which would've made the process of making models and the art style easier as it's more of what you're used to, nothing wild or different. However, the Mario Party 4 we got was extremely different and alien to the Mario Universe at the time and marks a definitive transition for many characters. Characters like Peach and Bowser were in Super Mario Sunshine, so it wasn't as big of a shock, but Mario Sunshine could've been shrugged off as ""Its a different local so it makes sense for Peach to wear a different dress."" But Mario Party 4 solidified her modern design, as well as all the other characters who weren't in Sunshine. 

Wario Changed, Luigi Changed, Waluigi Changed, and especially Daisy changed (for worse but that's my opinion.) For all those characters, you would have to redo character sheets and make new models that all have different proportions compared to their classic design. That's a lot of things that you have to do from scratch.

Point 5

That intro... the intro is rough. It's crude and it looks like it was made in Garry's Mod. It looks so far from professional and polished it's not even funny. It's rushed, it looks like somebody had 4 days to make an intro and this is the best they could do, and remember, this is the GameCube, this thing was built for fancy intros, look at Melee.

Point 6

At this point in time, Nintendo was changing as a company, the GameCube was brand new (and while I can't confirm this) was probably rushed to make an early release date since the Nintendo 64 DD flopped so hard. So they had to scramble to get the GameCube out and be as polished as possible (not confirmed, but it makes sense no? They had a lot planned for the 64 DD) so they can release it and transfer those games over to the GameCube.

Point 7

Sunshine was in development at this time, it didn't release until July 19, 2002 in Japan, which could've easily affected Mario Party 4 in numerous ways

So, if you haven't put it together, than it's all ok, because it seems circumstantial and you could easily say ""well ya, because of all that they didn't get to Party 4 until 2001,"" which is fair. 

However, my theory is, Mario Party 4 was initially a N64 game gonna act like Mario Party 2 did for Party 1, but in this case for Party 3, possibly with costumes and all. Mario Party 4 boards are all location type places like all the previous boards up to this point, so could easily provide costumes. This is how I think the costumes would've been per board;

Toads Midway Madness: Carnival/Circus costumes
Shy Guy Jungle Jam: Explorer or Tribal 
Goomba's Greedy Gala: Casino wear/suit and tie
Boo's Haunted Bash: Witches or Ghost Hunters
Koopa's Seaside Soiree: Resort Wear 
Bowser's Gnarly Party: Normal outfit

As development would've started shortly after Party 3, it would Line up for a December 2001 release or potentially later as Super Mario Sunshine was in development. As they were finishing the initial version of Party 4, they must've been told to make it on the GameCube and use new art style being used in Sunshine. So they would've rushed to redesign the characters (giving Daisy the worst design of them all), cut back on the celebration aspect of Party 4 (because it's weirdly celebratory of the franchise thus far) by cutting the Mario Party 1, 2, and 3 games they would've brought over (except Bowser's Blast because it's famous) and only focusing on the new minigames being made, hence why so few. They possibly could've made Toad playable by bringing back Tumble to be host, but because they couldn't they had to repurpose basic Mario enemies and Toad to be the hosts.

 It feels like I'm jumping to conclusions, which I very well am, but at the end of the day, there's a lot of aspects that make sense for Mario Party 4, being a celebration of Mario Party thus far, planned for the n64 (or 64 dd), switching consoles, art styles, and being affected by the development of the next big 3D Mario causing the game to be the cut back, rushed, and confusing title that it is today, which... calling it that means that the side modes we have must've been way bigger than we got. 

I don't know if it's true, but if it is, I would've liked to see what the real Mario Party 4 was like.",,17,,22,noflair,public

MARIOPARTY,Yoshi's Tropical Island in Mario Party Superstars,False,0,0,"Another rant about a remake of a board again...

Assuming that it is a 15 turn game with random bonus stars (standard online rules), Watermelon island (left side) is just better than Cantaloupe island (right side). This is from the developers deciding to add the shop onto the left side instead of koopa troopa gifting you 10 coins when passing the starting area. The problem is that the shop provides way too much value. Even before the half way mark, the custom dice block can be purchased which can help immensely in aiding you to get the star as you can purposefully land on happening spaces to give you the best chance of seeing toad. I know it doesn't guarantee you a star, but the odds are more towards your favor. Then after the half way mark, you can just buy golden pipes which can guarantee the star. Although expensive, it personally provides way too much control for this board.

In addition, it increases your likelihood of achieving bonus stars. If you stay on watermelon island, the shop star is close to being guaranteed especially if your opponents switch or stay on cantaloupe island. You also get a strong chance of getting the item bonus star too, the more items you buy, the more you have to use in addition to everyone picking up items from lucky spaces, items spaces or bowser himself. This essentially guarantees 2/9 bonus stars which is quite significant when dealing with random chance (not to mention that you probably have other bonus stars just from playing the game).

Now I know that Cantaloupe island isn't bad per say, I mean stealing stars from boo and possibly getting chance time is a nice touch, but for more consistency, I think it's better just to stay on watermelon island the majority of the time until you eventually buy the golden pipe and use it in the last couple of turns. 

I have actually played games where I did not move from watermelon island the entire time and won because of those reason. So what do you think?",,4,,0,noflair,public
MARIOPARTY,Do you think Mario Party Superstars had too much of an emphasis on the N64 Trilogy?,False,9,0,"IMO I think Mario Party Superstars is very good, and a true return to form for the series. However, I do think the game had a bit too much emphasis on the N64 trilogy. While I do enjoy those games too and more power to the people who has those as their favorites, imo the GameCube era was the best era of Mario Party and would have liked to see 1 board represented from each Mario Party game with the classic formula from 1-8, especially since Superstars is supposed to be a celebration of Mario Party as a whole and it would support the game with content for years to come, since it doesn't look like they'll be making a new one anytime soon. Would you have preferred to see the later Mario Party entries be represented more in Superstars?

I am not a fan wating for everyone else to take their turn as they're thinking for too long and started counting spaces of where they're going to land. And playing a Minigame after everyone's turn only slogs down the game further. Not to mention that getting Stars in those games are annoying to get to and having being stuck at one area of the map is never good.

9 and 10 fixed those issues and made the games a lot more enjoyable to play.

MARIOPARTY,They should bring Partner Party and Bowser Party back with each of them having 1 or 2 boards.,False,8,0,"This can help for those who like Car and Scramble gameplay.

Bowser Party is pretty much the best mode from Mario Party 10 and the reason anyone bothers to play 10, so this is a mode that can really ruin friendships, as long as they don't make Bowser too overpowered. Having a Reroll option should be completely gone or nerfed to be used twice per game.

Partner Party is sadly gone from Super but still can be played online. It's the Scramble gameplay that makes it more fun for each team to come up with strategies and how to find a way off into the Star Space at the same time for Double Stars. I also love having to split up with one going for items and coins while the other make their way towards the Star.

Specifically about Mario Party's 9 and 10. Which got me wondering about about a potential scenario. Would people be ok with the Party Car coming back, but as a side mode and not the main style of play?

The Mario Party games on the Nintendo GameCube had side content and modes people could play separate from the main gameplay which would be the traditional Mario Party gameplay. Mario Party 5 in particular had a mode that was kind of similar in nature to the Party Car, but instead everyone moved separately and Mini-Games still occurred at the end of each turn and, like Island Tour it was race to finish line. On top of this Superstars doesn't really have side content outside of Mt Minigames, and most games have modes where you can just play the minigames outright so it doesn't stand out. So it got me wondering, with a little tweaking of the Mario Party 9 and 10 Formula, would people be ok with it coming back via an update as a little something extra people can do?

So, first of all, for everyone who has no idea what I am talking about (as this is a pretty hidden mechanic) in Super Mario Party in case you fail a mini game 3 times you get to skip it to the next mini game on the challenge road.

The reason why I ask is because I am currently routing all gems for speedrunning and see potential time saves compared to the current route used for the challenge road part assuming I do not have to win a certain amount of mini games, the run already uses some intentional losses but I see some additional ones that would save several seconds each. Does anyone know if there is certain amounts of mini games that has to be won, or if there are certain mini games I have to win to get the gem or to progress? I would gladly experiment myself on this matter, but the problem is that to get to the point I get to experiment it will take me around 5 hours of unlocking all mini games on a new file so it sadly isn't something that is super easy to check on myself.",,2,,3,bowser,public

MARIOPARTY,DS is more broken than Super,False,6,0,"I see criticism about Super being broken with its Allies and items being cheap, but you guys probably haven't played Mario Party DS yet. That game is the most broken Mario Party game in the series all because of how the game was made to be.

DS had the smallest maps in the series. Items are extremely cheap as well. A Double Dice Block was 3 Coins while Triple was 5. So you can run circles around the boards throughout the whole game. They were, of course the quickest way to get to the Star and even the game was very generous of giving you a lot of Coins thanks to some of the Happening Spaces that are short, but very easy event games that reward you with 15 to 20 Coins. Then you have the Hexes around the boards you obtained by running into. Mostly a lot of them steal Coins from other players, but some also steal Stars and even some Hexes give you Star Blocks that you can land and easily try to get on that space you planted that Block to get a Star!

But the most broken thing about DS that I really enjoyed, was that you can buy as many items as you want instead of buying one item per store visit. That, and you can replace items you already were holding as well. Why yes, I'll take 3 Double Dice Blocks or 3 Golden Pipes. With all these fat stacks of Coins I have, I just use those Pipes, run back to the store and buy even more! You can end up with more than 10 Stars in this game because of how short the boards are and how cheap the items are in this game.

Super reminds of DS and I think DS is much more of a wilder game compared to any other game in the series because of how OP almost everything is. I would still recommend the game as it's fast, frantic, and fun! I think not many people would notice or care about that since Mario Party games in handheld systems are often overlooked.",,6,,6,hammerbro,public

MARIOPARTY,I Think I‚Äôm so Unlucky in Mario Party Superstars,False,4,0,"I've been playing all Mario party with my friends, from 1 to superstars (we started playing in 2021 weekly each game and each board in order. We played often before 2021, but never from 1 to the last game) and so far this is the Mario party I've been more unlucky, I lost all the boards in 4th place. 

The problem is that I was winning at least 4 of them until turn 20 or so and then something random happens and I end up losing.

**Yoshi‚Äôs Tropical Island**

Chance time, I gave all my stars to the 4th place in turn 27 (I gave 6 stars and I got 2).

**Space Land**

I got in 4th place just for one bonus star, I was in third place in most of the game.

**Peach‚Äôs Birthday Cake**

I was in 1st place until turn 28, I landed in the last 2 turns in 3 piranha plants (that steal stars), each one for a different friend, so I lost 3 stars and each of them got one, also no one landed on my piranha plant space. 

 **Woody Woods**

First place until turn 22, I had 150 coins, then one friend landed on a bowser space and bowser revolution happens, we all got around 40 coins, then someone landed on a chance time and I lost 30 coins. Suddenly all of them got money thanks for lucky spaces and all of them got a lot of golden pipes and I lost (if it wasn't for the golden pipes I would have won because I got more stars ""legit"")

**Horror Land**

My brother used the king boo and stole 3 stars from all of us, then from turn 20 or so I started to get low numbers so I couldn't get any star or steal a star with a boo (the day changed to night), all my friends got a lot of coins (I hate lucky spaces) and stars, 

**TL;DR**

I got in 4th place thanks to random things like chance times, bad dice numbers or randoms things.

I don't know if I'm just unlucky in this game (I used DK, don't know if that's relevant) or maybe the game is a little unbalanced (golden pipes shouldn't cost the same for all players for example)

I think the game is good and maybe one of the better, if not the best modern Mario party, but thanks to losing (salty) I didn't like it, now I feel that each time I play it again I will lose no matter what.

Anyway, if someone have any tips for this game I would like to read them, also, did you had any other similar situations with this game?",,4,,4,noflair,public

The fact that the timer only appears in Decathlon Stadium means that you have only one chance to do this outside of practice mode, unless using an emulator. Retrying means resetting the Decathlon and playing the first mini-game again, which is very tedious.

All of this is to highlight how amazing this world record performance by BlueStar is. He achieves 13""13, not once but twice(!) in a row - first in practice mode, second after hitting start which achieved a 996 point total. Do give it a watch (video below).

Believe it or not I‚Äôm 44 and never played a Mario Party game! We have a 5 and 7 year old and my llong dream is to have some video game buddies in them. Their gaming exposure has been Mario Kart 8, Smash, a little bit of Mario Maker and (the most successful one) has been Paw Patrol On a Roll.

I got to thinking a Mario Party might be fun for us all to play together. Most of my research has led me to believe Superstar is the better choice over Super Mario Party but just to confirm is it? Is Superstars a good first Mario Party for me but also a good one for young kids? 

I really know nothing about the series other than they are basically digital board games.

MARIOPARTY,Ice-cold take: I still really want Superstars DLC,False,30,0,"My mind races with ideas for post-launch content. I mean seriously, all the other Mario spin-offs get free post-launch content, meanwhile I would PAY for Mario Party DLC. Plus I‚Äôm pretty sure Superstars sold more than most of these spin-offs, but I‚Äôm getting petty now.

Here are some of the things I would want most from Mario Party DLC:

‚Ä¢The Party Pass

A full season pass of content featuring (ideally):

-5 boards

-50 minigames

-10 characters

-Associated encyclopaedia pages, music, stickers, and card designs

It would be released in waves, each wave featuring 1 board, 10 minigames, and 2 characters, releasing over the span of, say, a year. I don‚Äôt know what the price would be.

The rest of these ideas, I envision being released in free updates.

‚Ä¢Intense Ruleset

An altered version of the base ruleset featuring bigger stakes and more punishing events. Some changes include:

-Bowser Spaces are more punishing

-Bowser Minigames threaten to take half or all of your coins instead of just 10 (maybe even a star could be put on the line)

-VS Space coin pots are higher (from 10 to 20 even up to 50 coins are taken from players)

-Duels can now have Stars put on the line instead of just coins

-Koopa Banks now take 5 coins from the start

-There will now be 3 random Bonus Stars instead of 2 regardless of the turn count

-Boos will take more coins from players, but now cost coins to steal coins as well

And other minor changes, probably

‚Ä¢Misc. Free Updates

-More minigames would be given leaderboards and high score modes

-The ability to create custom minigame packs

-More Stickers and Card Designs

-The ability to choose how many Bonus Stars are awarded at the end of a game, and which ones can be awarded

Am I wishing for too much? Absolutely. Am I going to keep doing so? You bet!",,5,,30,noflair,public
MARIOPARTY,Hot take on every MP game,False,6,0,"MP1: This game doesn't work with 20 turns, there are no items so you can't move fast, 35 turns works better with this one. Also Wario's Battle Canyon is a great board.

MP2: Pirate land sucks, you spend most of your time at the beggining of the map (between the bridge, the shark and the shortcuts, everytging goes back to the beggining).

MP3: Why does Waluigi's island need to have a path with a 50/50 chance of going back to the beggining? Why does Chilly Waters need to have a chance of you slipping and not advancing? Why do people think these are the best boards of the game?

MP4: Booksquirm isn't that good, it often ends up in a tie if at least 2 people are decent at the game. Also Reverse-a-bomb and bob-omb breakers are underrated

MP5: Why would you even use an orb on a space? (except bob-omb orb, it's a great item)

MP6: The night/day mechanic mostly blocks stuff. It blocks paths on certain bords, it prevents DK/Bowser spaces from happening on the night/day, it prevent you from going to boo during the day, it prevents some minigames to play during day/night, and so on.

MP7: Neon heights star mechanic ruins what could have been one the best boards (and the lakitu orb is too cheap when you can get coins from the ""board's minigames"", even if it doesn't garantee the star)

MP8: Koopa's tycoon town looks so generic.

MP9: I wanted to say something good about this game but it's actually hard to find anything that's really good. The car mechanic is decent but 4-player boss minigames just don't work, and the last hit is stupid.

MP10: Bowser party had the potential to be the best side mode ever created.

Super MP: Partner party is more fun than the main mode

MP Superstars: Peach's birthday cake changes are nice, but I prefered when the Goomba made you skip the star. Also it doesn't really work in this game because items means you'll often skip happening spaces, and it needs a lot of turn to get interesting (30 in not enough imo if you want the pirhanna plants to cause chaos). Though I loved the idea of them trying to turn one of the worst boards of the series into a decent one. I think it had great potential, unlike Yoshi's tropical island, which is a very boring uninteristing board.

-- Handheld games --

MP Advance: It's a ton of fun, and the best solo experience Mario Party has to offer.

MP DS: Why do people never talk about how great the multiplayer is for a DS game? You have the full game up to 4 players, and 2 bonus minigames, with a single cartridge! It even has some stuff that take advantage of people having their own screen in some minigames and on the board.

MP Island Tour: The game is decent but it's only good as a multiplayer experience, which is a shame because it's a handheld game so you're mostly going to play it solo.

MP Star Rush: I really have no idea why I spent so much time in Mario Shuffle. Also Toad Scramble is a lot of fun.

MP Top 100: I love how they brought back Kareening Koopas as a duel minigame. Such a great minigame but it was stuck in story mode/minigame mode in MP4. Wish they brought it back in Superstars.",,6,,6,noflair,public

This new TAS video by ItzKy shows the possibility of achieving the elusive final 1000 point score in Chomp Romp. It remains to be seen whether someone will eventually achieve it RTA, or harder yet on console outside of practice mode. Nevertheless it is now possible to achieve the perfect 10000 points in Mario Party 5 Decathlon.

Lengthy post so bare with me, just occurred to me what Nintendo could do with Superstars!

Turn it into the ‚ÄúSmash Ultimate‚Äù of MPs!! So recreate all the boards (1-8, maybe 9+ later on?) and release them in packs!

Treat it how you would the MK8 Booster Course, so every direct we could get a reveal of courses for MK but also boards/minigames/characters for Superstars!

Next thing you‚Äôre thinking is, that‚Äôll make online difficult to find a board people are playing! Ahh, but we have the Switch Online App! Nintendo beg people to use it, so here‚Äôs an idea (basically discord):

- Create a chat function on there‚Ä¶
- Put a post asking to find players for a particular board and create chat rooms!!

MARIOPARTY,My biggest annoyance with Mario Party Superstars:,False,18,0,"To state the obvious: it's a good game. Best Mario Party since the Gamecube days. Lets get that out of the way so no one is getting upset that over relatively minor gripes about the game.

&amp;#x200B;

1 thing I find objectively bad are the CPUs. Just played vs master CPUs, but their choices are incredibly dumb. Like, almost any time they're within 10 of a star and have a custom dice block, they'll go for some super random roll that doesn't get them the star. This happens A LOT.  More often that not even. And that's ""master"" mode. They'll make such nonsensical choices with items that are indistinguishable from 'easy' setting.

Now of course, Mario Party is better when you have 4 actual people playing, but even then, that's not a good enough excuse. 

I got the game 2 months ago and have played it a lot (which is testament that it's Mario Party giving us generally what we want), but I do have a good amount of complaints about it. Not gonna list them here, but I do wonder if standards are a bit low. We're all happy to get a recognizable Mario Party we know and love, but I think for what is a 'best of' collection, things could be far better.",,11,,18,noflair,public

MARIOPARTY,"In my opinion, Superstars gives you WAY too much money and not nearly enough of a threat (still a fun game though)",False,11,0,"In Mario Party Superstars, the game gives you WAY too much money. In the original games, it wasnt uncommon to have at least 30 coins at max when you reach a star, making things like bowser spaces feel like a game changing threat to whoever was on the receiving end and it also made you feel luckier if the game decided for the cursor to land on something like ""100 Star Present"" because if it lands there, bowser runs away without giving or taking anything.

This also applies to chance time. Because the game gives you so many coins, its not uncommon for a player to get a lot of overpowered items like golden pipes which instantly take you over to the nearest star and then be in the lead in like 3 turns or more, so when it takes coins, it doesnt take that many, which again takes away the feeling on anxiety that players get upon someone landing on chance time or bowser.

Heres a few clips of peoples reactions to chance time:

A mario party 6 clip: https://youtu.be/pIJJTI-oODQ

A compilation of chance times from TheRunawayGuys: https://youtu.be/G-tSCHjP-FQ

A compilation of chance times from Brainscratch Commentaries: https://youtu.be/l8WaqT1Yz_g

Most of the time in the original games, chance time will take away a large amount of stars and/or coins at CRUCIAL moments in the game (you can see an example of that in the first clip).

I wouldnt mind the game giving you so many coins if it dished out more consequences (Example: Taking away coins for losing minigames, taking away stars for landing on the bank in bowsers magma mountain with no coins left, bowser being able to take more coins if the player exceeds 100 coins, etc)

That said, I still think superstars is a fun game. This is just something that slightly irks me about it.",,9,,11,noflair,public

MARIOPARTY,weird mini game flex,False,1,0,"So over the years I have unintentionally developed a random quirk. 
So of all the years I've played Mario party, there is one mini game I would never lose. It's not a matter of skill either but pure dumb luck.
The mini game in question is bowsers big blast.
If I were to put a number to how many times I've played this specific mini game, I would guess 46-47 times.
And every single time I have, regardless of against the A.I. or friends, won.

Now I am a little aware that there is a statistic for this game.

If you go first at the get go, you have a 1/5 chance of hitting the detonator. If you go second it becomes a 1/4 chance and then a 1/3 chance if third and keeps going until the detonator switch can be guessed as the last one and then resets.

When there is 3 players, it scales down from 1/4 chance, to 1/3 chance to 1/2 chance.
Finally with the last set of players(2), it goes from 1/3 chance, to 1/2 chance.

Those are something that you can very easily pick up on the chances from watching the game/playing it.

However, I am apparently a very unlikely annomaly were i have gone 46-47 games of this and not lost once.

Im sure someone who is very good at statistics or math can tell me somewhere here how statistically improbable this all is.

Obviously they can't reuse stuff from these games in order to make boards, so in this hypothetical they would still have to make new boards from the ground up, but i was wondering if i would be frustrated if that ended happening.

I would have no problem with minigames and characters from Super being straight ported as long as the cost were low, but i would really dislike if there were a significant difference in graphics between the minigames brought from Top 100 and the ones already in the game.",,0,,1,noflair,public

MARIOPARTY,An old mans Mario Party tier list,False,7,0,"I've played Mario Party since the original back on the n64. I remember being a kid and could never win, constantly losing out at the end... The game was brutal but when I matured and returned to it, I found a game of strategy, skill, and substance. I try not to rank based on mini-game selection because each game has its good and bad minigames. This is strictly decided by Party Mode.

1) Mario Party 3

Mario Party 3 has the original rule set and feel of what Mario Party was created to be. More items, more chaos, and weirdly enough-more control over your destiny.

2) Mario Party 6

I'll put Mario Party 6 here because it differentiates itself from the GameCube games by creating a more competitive and strategic atmosphere. The Day n' Night (Kid Cudi) system allows for more strategy, and having an item shop to buy orbs gives players more control over what is happening. These elements are somewhat missing from other Gamecube parties. It's not my personal number 2, but its features cannot be overlooked.

3) Mario Party Superstars

Classic game with updated models, boards, and quality of life features. Had the potential to be number 1 but there isn't as much control over the outcome as in other games and not enough boards to keep the fun going. A safe and serviceable game.

4) Mario Party 2

Mario Party 2 cleans up what Mario Party 1 made a mess of. The minigames are better designed. Items were added in for the first time ever. This game has a ton of personality to it. While having a competitive environment, it removes some of the more brutal features from Mario Party 1. Maybe that's to its credit but it over-delivers everywhere else.

5) Mario Party 1

I know it sounds as if my bias is talking, but honestly, if it was, this game would be ranked number 1. This game is all about knowledge and skill (Okay maybe 90%). There are no items in the first installment but to make up for that, minigames are made to mean so much more. If a player loses a minigame, they are likely to lose coins. Coins don't come so easily in this game. If you have a fat stack, you've earned it. Some of the minigames are brutal, both in-game and on your palms, but the feeling you get from playing this game hasn't been replicated since. This game is not for the faint of heart or for fractured friendships.

6) Mario Party 7

This game is unique, it has very outward thinking boards and I think that it pulls them off well enough. The item variety is also great in this game. Though these things do somewhat work in its favor, it detracts from the classic Mario party game feel. Each board almost feels like an entirely different game, which works for some but not for others. A polarizing game for sure.

7) Mario Party 5

Mario Party 5 introduces orbs or capsules (whatever they call it) and on the surface they are interesting. You can place them on the board or use them directly. The issue with them is that they are given out at random. This makes the game more challenging to take control of. Some of the boards are okay but none of them really stand out to me. Where Mario Party 7 kindve over-delivered, I feel as if Mario party 5 delivered the package an hour late. You still got it but not how you expected it. I sometimes feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience and are watching the game make the plays for me. Mario Party 6 does everything this game does but better. Not the worst, not the best.

8) Mario Party 8\*\*\*\*

This is the game I'm least familiar with. I did play it originally back on the Wii but I was becoming a teenager at the time and so my interests lay elsewhere. Since it's the final game I haven't revisited, I'll put Mario Party 8 at the 8 spot. Could easily be ranked higher but there's not a chance that it ranks lower.

9) Super Mario Party

Smaller boards and less turns (default setting), it's supposed to be a 'quicker' Mario party game. Not the typical hour+ drawn out Party modes that we've come to expect. This makes it somewhat unique. Yet instead of being an adrenaline-inducing, sprint to the finish, action movie explosion, it feels like an empty soulless game. As if it's trying to kick you out of their hypothetical restaurant before it actually closes. The item selection is okay and the boards are (meh) *okay* but nothing wows me. There's nothing that this game's party mode does particularly well or better than its predecessors.

10)  Mario Party 4

This game is just bland. The item selection is horrible. The animations slow the game down considerably. The boards are average at best, and uninspired to say the least. While there is some strategy, it doesn't feel as intuitive. It's the first GameCube party, and the only GameCube title to have the classic n64 rules. Outside of that extremely niche reason, gameplay-wise, there's no reason to play this game over the ones above it.

11) Mario Party 9

Each character is in a cart along with one another as they go through each board together. Almost completely luck-based. Almost everything that made Mario Party enjoyable was taken away in this installment. Flip a coin, if it's heads, you just won the party mode.

12) Mario Party 10

Each character is in a cart along with one another as they go through each board togeth.... Wait, its basically the same game. Flip a coin, if its tails, you just won the party mode.",,7,,7,wario,public

I'd like to see the return of this mechanic but with some minor tweaks personally. 

- Originally the AI was pretty dumb and Bowser would take random paths sometimes missing an opportunity to crush players. The AI should be updated to go after the nearest player with coins. 

- Maybe not take all coins as that's a bit brutal and we have the Bowser laser for that lol. Maybe half is sufficient.

If I were to fix this, I would have it to the traditional way of players running around to collect a Star that's randomly placed on specific spaces. Keep the Chain Chomps the way they are and also give the option for players to also steal Coins if they're in the way and have no Stars. Maybe remove a few Chain Chomp Houses to make it more fair.

I like the minigames
The boss battles

MARIOPARTY,My biggest issues with Superstars:,False,5,0,"Generally new to sub, so apologize if this is a repost: I like Mario Party Superstars overall but there are three things that piss me off about it. One is the amount of lucky spaces, which I‚Äôm sure is a typical complaint. Someone, in almost every single turn lands on one. It‚Äôs ridiculous. I remember when they were introduced in 8, they were actually Lucky but now it feels that they‚Äôre about as common as blue spaces. The second, is the objects available‚Äî I really hate the Golden Pipe and chain chomp call. Every single NPC buys the freaking chain chomp whistle. It devolves this game into a complete crap shoot of where the star is and at what time, and if it‚Äôs nowhere close to you there‚Äôs no need to worry because it‚Äôs just going to get whisked away the second anyone does. And then there‚Äôs the Golden Pipe. Same issue as the whistle, once it‚Äôs available in the second half, anyone with 25 coins will purchase it. And because of the scale of lucky spaces as previously mentioned just about everyone does at the halfway point. It makes the strategy/luck aspect so loose and makes it a competition of who can visit the store most. And my third and final complaint are coin minigames. They‚Äôre too common and so overpowered, in previous games there would be times where the whole game would pass and no coin mini game ever showed up but now you can end up playing 2-3 in longer games and exacerbate the ‚Äúeveryone is rich‚Äù issue.

But say it was added in for at least 1-2 boards. How would you balance it out?

I'd either go with giving it a very high cost (i.e. 15-20 coins) or make it so you cannot target yourself with it. I imagine the former would be preferable because most players didn't use the Reverse Mushroom on opponents except in very specific circumstances, and players would be rubbed the wrong way if they couldn't use it on themselves. Alternatively, if the cost were kept low, I'd have it so you would be limited to rolling a 1-5, reducing the amount of shenanigans you can pull off with it.",,17,,9,noflair,public

MARIOPARTY,What boards do you want and think would be in a Gamecube DLC Pack/Superstar 2?,False,8,0,"Rules are simple. We‚Äôre pretending Mario Party Superstars 2 or a DLC pack will focus on the Gamecube games. You only get to pick 5 boards.

However, you‚Äôll make 2 lists. 
One of what boards you would WANT, and the other one is what boards you think would actually get picked
So, for Example‚Ä¶.

I would want‚Ä¶

1. Neon Heights

2. Pagoda‚Äôs Peak

3. Windmillville

4. Castaway Bay

5. Bowser‚Äôs Enchanted Inferno

Clearly MP7 is my absolute favorite of the group, but it‚Äôs what I want, not balance or logic lol


What I think we will get‚Ä¶

1. Sweet Dream

2. Bowser‚Äôs Nightmare

3. Toad‚Äôs Midway Madness

4. Castaway Bay

5. Pyramid Park

I think the second list is terrible, but I feel like this is a fairly accurate guess and here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶

I feel like they would give us 2 from Mario Party 5 for sure because it had the most boards AND is the favorite according to the poll on Superstars. Although, I could really see them going with almost any 2 from MP5, except Future Dream since they already remade a map in space, but I also feel like they would give us a Bowser Board for this round since so many people asked for it, and since MP5 gets 2 boards, that would likely be where the Bowser board comes from.
I feel like since they didn‚Äôt go with Mario‚Äôs Rainbow Castle in Superstars, they‚Äôll go with Castaway Bay since it‚Äôs the spiritual successor AND one of the few linear boards on the Gamecube.
Since they made three different versions of star stealing maps I feel like they would absolutely go with one of them, likely Pyramid Park since it was the newer and improved version and because we need a map from MP7. 
Then for an MP4 board they would probably go for Toad‚Äôs Midway Madness. This is the pick I‚Äôm least certain of because I could also see it being Shy Guy‚Äôs Jungle Jam, but all the other MP4 picks seem unlikely.

But this is just me and my opinion. I want to hear which 5 you WANT and what 5 you THINK they would do!",,17,,8,diddykong,public

The fact that the timer only appears in Decathlon Stadium means that you have only one chance to do this outside of practice mode, unless using an emulator. Retrying means resetting the Decathlon and playing the first mini-game again, which is very tedious.

All of this is to highlight how amazing this world record performance by BlueStar is. He achieves 13""13, not once but twice(!) in a row - first in practice mode, second after hitting start which achieved a 996 point total. Do give it a watch (video below).

Believe it or not I‚Äôm 44 and never played a Mario Party game! We have a 5 and 7 year old and my llong dream is to have some video game buddies in them. Their gaming exposure has been Mario Kart 8, Smash, a little bit of Mario Maker and (the most successful one) has been Paw Patrol On a Roll.

I got to thinking a Mario Party might be fun for us all to play together. Most of my research has led me to believe Superstar is the better choice over Super Mario Party but just to confirm is it? Is Superstars a good first Mario Party for me but also a good one for young kids? 

I really know nothing about the series other than they are basically digital board games.

MARIOPARTY,Ice-cold take: I still really want Superstars DLC,False,29,0,"My mind races with ideas for post-launch content. I mean seriously, all the other Mario spin-offs get free post-launch content, meanwhile I would PAY for Mario Party DLC. Plus I‚Äôm pretty sure Superstars sold more than most of these spin-offs, but I‚Äôm getting petty now.

Here are some of the things I would want most from Mario Party DLC:

‚Ä¢The Party Pass

A full season pass of content featuring (ideally):

-5 boards

-50 minigames

-10 characters

-Associated encyclopaedia pages, music, stickers, and card designs

It would be released in waves, each wave featuring 1 board, 10 minigames, and 2 characters, releasing over the span of, say, a year. I don‚Äôt know what the price would be.

The rest of these ideas, I envision being released in free updates.

‚Ä¢Intense Ruleset

An altered version of the base ruleset featuring bigger stakes and more punishing events. Some changes include:

-Bowser Spaces are more punishing

-Bowser Minigames threaten to take half or all of your coins instead of just 10 (maybe even a star could be put on the line)

-VS Space coin pots are higher (from 10 to 20 even up to 50 coins are taken from players)

-Duels can now have Stars put on the line instead of just coins

-Koopa Banks now take 5 coins from the start

-There will now be 3 random Bonus Stars instead of 2 regardless of the turn count

-Boos will take more coins from players, but now cost coins to steal coins as well

And other minor changes, probably

‚Ä¢Misc. Free Updates

-More minigames would be given leaderboards and high score modes

-The ability to create custom minigame packs

-More Stickers and Card Designs

-The ability to choose how many Bonus Stars are awarded at the end of a game, and which ones can be awarded

Am I wishing for too much? Absolutely. Am I going to keep doing so? You bet!",,5,,29,noflair,public
MARIOPARTY,Hot take on every MP game,False,5,0,"MP1: This game doesn't work with 20 turns, there are no items so you can't move fast, 35 turns works better with this one. Also Wario's Battle Canyon is a great board.

MP2: Pirate land sucks, you spend most of your time at the beggining of the map (between the bridge, the shark and the shortcuts, everytging goes back to the beggining).

MP3: Why does Waluigi's island need to have a path with a 50/50 chance of going back to the beggining? Why does Chilly Waters need to have a chance of you slipping and not advancing? Why do people think these are the best boards of the game?

MP4: Booksquirm isn't that good, it often ends up in a tie if at least 2 people are decent at the game. Also Reverse-a-bomb and bob-omb breakers are underrated

MP5: Why would you even use an orb on a space? (except bob-omb orb, it's a great item)

MP6: The night/day mechanic mostly blocks stuff. It blocks paths on certain bords, it prevents DK/Bowser spaces from happening on the night/day, it prevent you from going to boo during the day, it prevents some minigames to play during day/night, and so on.

MP7: Neon heights star mechanic ruins what could have been one the best boards (and the lakitu orb is too cheap when you can get coins from the ""board's minigames"", even if it doesn't garantee the star)

MP8: Koopa's tycoon town looks so generic.

MP9: I wanted to say something good about this game but it's actually hard to find anything that's really good. The car mechanic is decent but 4-player boss minigames just don't work, and the last hit is stupid.

MP10: Bowser party had the potential to be the best side mode ever created.

Super MP: Partner party is more fun than the main mode

MP Superstars: Peach's birthday cake changes are nice, but I prefered when the Goomba made you skip the star. Also it doesn't really work in this game because items means you'll often skip happening spaces, and it needs a lot of turn to get interesting (30 in not enough imo if you want the pirhanna plants to cause chaos). Though I loved the idea of them trying to turn one of the worst boards of the series into a decent one. I think it had great potential, unlike Yoshi's tropical island, which is a very boring uninteristing board.

-- Handheld games --

MP Advance: It's a ton of fun, and the best solo experience Mario Party has to offer.

MP DS: Why do people never talk about how great the multiplayer is for a DS game? You have the full game up to 4 players, and 2 bonus minigames, with a single cartridge! It even has some stuff that take advantage of people having their own screen in some minigames and on the board.

MP Island Tour: The game is decent but it's only good as a multiplayer experience, which is a shame because it's a handheld game so you're mostly going to play it solo.

MP Star Rush: I really have no idea why I spent so much time in Mario Shuffle. Also Toad Scramble is a lot of fun.

MP Top 100: I love how they brought back Kareening Koopas as a duel minigame. Such a great minigame but it was stuck in story mode/minigame mode in MP4. Wish they brought it back in Superstars.",,6,,5,noflair,public

Lengthy post so bare with me, just occurred to me what Nintendo could do with Superstars!

Treat it how you would the MK8 Booster Course, so every direct we could get a reveal of courses for MK but also boards/minigames/characters for Superstars!

Next thing you‚Äôre thinking is, that‚Äôll make online difficult to find a board people are playing! Ahh, but we have the Switch Online App! Nintendo beg people to use it, so here‚Äôs an idea (basically discord):

- Create a chat function on there‚Ä¶

1 thing I find objectively bad are the CPUs. Just played vs master CPUs, but their choices are incredibly dumb.

And that's ""master"" mode. They'll make such nonsensical choices with items that are indistinguishable from 'easy' setting.

Now of course, Mario Party is better when you have 4 actual people playing, but even then, that's not a good enough excuse. 

I got the game 2 months ago and have played it a lot (which is testament that it's Mario Party giving us generally what we want), but I do have a good amount of complaints about it. Not gonna list them here, but I do wonder if standards are a bit low. We're all happy to get a recognizable Mario Party we know and love, but I think for what is a 'best of' collection, things could be far better.",,11,,16,noflair,public

Crash Bash - Obviously Sony‚Äôs attempt to make their version of Mario Party‚Ä¶ that was not good. Just minigames‚Ä¶ on repeat‚Ä¶.

I think the only time stars should be that cheap is in a Pagoda‚Äôs Peak situation where the price consistently changes and you can‚Äôt really plan for it.

So, I would either‚Ä¶

-Make it so Twila only sold stars for 20 or more coins, or‚Ä¶

-Have it where every time someone buys a star, the price changes so I can‚Äôt just loop around the circle with a golden mushroom and get 15 stars for less than a hundred coins (which I basically did last time I played), or‚Ä¶

-I make it so that you literally don‚Äôt know the price Twila is charging. Twila rolls a
dice every time someone shows up, and then you have to debate if you want to buy it now or risk coming back when it could be lower or higher. You could literally pass him twice on 1 turn and get two different prices because it changes every time.

MARIOPARTY,An old mans Mario Party tier list,False,8,0,"I've played Mario Party since the original back on the n64. I remember being a kid and could never win, constantly losing out at the end... The game was brutal but when I matured and returned to it, I found a game of strategy, skill, and substance. I try not to rank based on mini-game selection because each game has its good and bad minigames. This is strictly decided by Party Mode.

1) Mario Party 3

Mario Party 3 has the original rule set and feel of what Mario Party was created to be. More items, more chaos, and weirdly enough-more control over your destiny.

2) Mario Party 6

I'll put Mario Party 6 here because it differentiates itself from the GameCube games by creating a more competitive and strategic atmosphere. The Day n' Night (Kid Cudi) system allows for more strategy, and having an item shop to buy orbs gives players more control over what is happening. These elements are somewhat missing from other Gamecube parties. It's not my personal number 2, but its features cannot be overlooked.

3) Mario Party Superstars

Classic game with updated models, boards, and quality of life features. Had the potential to be number 1 but there isn't as much control over the outcome as in other games and not enough boards to keep the fun going. A safe and serviceable game.

4) Mario Party 2

Mario Party 2 cleans up what Mario Party 1 made a mess of. The minigames are better designed. Items were added in for the first time ever. This game has a ton of personality to it. While having a competitive environment, it removes some of the more brutal features from Mario Party 1. Maybe that's to its credit but it over-delivers everywhere else.

5) Mario Party 1

I know it sounds as if my bias is talking, but honestly, if it was, this game would be ranked number 1. This game is all about knowledge and skill (Okay maybe 90%). There are no items in the first installment but to make up for that, minigames are made to mean so much more. If a player loses a minigame, they are likely to lose coins. Coins don't come so easily in this game. If you have a fat stack, you've earned it. Some of the minigames are brutal, both in-game and on your palms, but the feeling you get from playing this game hasn't been replicated since. This game is not for the faint of heart or for fractured friendships.

6) Mario Party 7

This game is unique, it has very outward thinking boards and I think that it pulls them off well enough. The item variety is also great in this game. Though these things do somewhat work in its favor, it detracts from the classic Mario party game feel. Each board almost feels like an entirely different game, which works for some but not for others. A polarizing game for sure.

7) Mario Party 5

Mario Party 5 introduces orbs or capsules (whatever they call it) and on the surface they are interesting. You can place them on the board or use them directly. The issue with them is that they are given out at random. This makes the game more challenging to take control of. Some of the boards are okay but none of them really stand out to me. Where Mario Party 7 kindve over-delivered, I feel as if Mario party 5 delivered the package an hour late. You still got it but not how you expected it. I sometimes feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience and are watching the game make the plays for me. Mario Party 6 does everything this game does but better. Not the worst, not the best.

8) Mario Party 8\*\*\*\*

This is the game I'm least familiar with. I did play it originally back on the Wii but I was becoming a teenager at the time and so my interests lay elsewhere. Since it's the final game I haven't revisited, I'll put Mario Party 8 at the 8 spot. Could easily be ranked higher but there's not a chance that it ranks lower.

9) Super Mario Party

Smaller boards and less turns (default setting), it's supposed to be a 'quicker' Mario party game. Not the typical hour+ drawn out Party modes that we've come to expect. This makes it somewhat unique. Yet instead of being an adrenaline-inducing, sprint to the finish, action movie explosion, it feels like an empty soulless game. As if it's trying to kick you out of their hypothetical restaurant before it actually closes. The item selection is okay and the boards are (meh) *okay* but nothing wows me. There's nothing that this game's party mode does particularly well or better than its predecessors.

10)  Mario Party 4

This game is just bland. The item selection is horrible. The animations slow the game down considerably. The boards are average at best, and uninspired to say the least. While there is some strategy, it doesn't feel as intuitive. It's the first GameCube party, and the only GameCube title to have the classic n64 rules. Outside of that extremely niche reason, gameplay-wise, there's no reason to play this game over the ones above it.

11) Mario Party 9

Each character is in a cart along with one another as they go through each board together. Almost completely luck-based. Almost everything that made Mario Party enjoyable was taken away in this installment. Flip a coin, if it's heads, you just won the party mode.

12) Mario Party 10

Each character is in a cart along with one another as they go through each board togeth.... Wait, its basically the same game. Flip a coin, if its tails, you just won the party mode.",,7,,8,wario,public

I'd like to see the return of this mechanic but with some minor tweaks personally. 

- Originally the AI was pretty dumb and Bowser would take random paths sometimes missing an opportunity to crush players. The AI should be updated to go after the nearest player with coins. 

- Maybe not take all coins as that's a bit brutal and we have the Bowser laser for that lol. Maybe half is sufficient.

Nd Cube loves to make something new for Mario Party and it shows. While 10 isn't really new in the Car formula, Bowser Party did make the gameplay fresh enough for a good amount of people to enjoy.

I, for one, would be interested in a completely different Mario Party game. I had given the modern games a try at least twice and I have liked a good amount of them.

I like the minigames
The boss battles
And the title screen and superstar screen(but only for 9)

And what about the items? Theres no reverse mushroom or bowser suit or bowser phone. The shop system in Mario Party 3 was pretty cool!  


We don't even have a Bowser map!  


Speaking of Bowser, only 1 Bowser minigame and no other gimmick gamemodes like game guy (my fav) or the matching minigame from 7 to really bet your coins and make some serious bank!  


Also, as a personal issue, I wish you could turn off all the noises the characters make whenever they do anything in a minigame",,9,,7,noflair,public

But say it was added in for at least 1-2 boards. How would you balance it out?

I'd either go with giving it a very high cost (i.e. 15-20 coins) or make it so you cannot target yourself with it. I imagine the former would be preferable because most players didn't use the Reverse Mushroom on opponents except in very specific circumstances, and players would be rubbed the wrong way if they couldn't use it on themselves. Alternatively, if the cost were kept low, I'd have it so you would be limited to rolling a 1-5, reducing the amount of shenanigans you can pull off with it.",,17,,10,noflair,public

While I do enjoy those games too and more power to the people who has those as their favorites, imo the GameCube era was the best era of Mario Party and would have liked to see 1 board represented from each Mario Party game with the classic formula from 1-8, especially since Superstars is supposed to be a celebration of Mario Party as a whole and it would support the game with content for years to come, since it doesn't look like they'll be making a new one anytime soon.

MARIOPARTY,They should bring Partner Party and Bowser Party back with each of them having 1 or 2 boards.,False,9,0,"This can help for those who like Car and Scramble gameplay.

Bowser Party is pretty much the best mode from Mario Party 10 and the reason anyone bothers to play 10, so this is a mode that can really ruin friendships, as long as they don't make Bowser too overpowered. Having a Reroll option should be completely gone or nerfed to be used twice per game.

Partner Party is sadly gone from Super but still can be played online. It's the Scramble gameplay that makes it more fun for each team to come up with strategies and how to find a way off into the Star Space at the same time for Double Stars. I also love having to split up with one going for items and coins while the other make their way towards the Star.

This new TAS video by ItzKy shows the possibility of achieving the elusive final 1000 point score in Chomp Romp. It remains to be seen whether someone will eventually achieve it RTA, or harder yet on console outside of practice mode. Nevertheless it is now possible to achieve the perfect 10000 points in Mario Party 5 Decathlon.

MARIOPARTY,"In my opinion, Superstars gives you WAY too much money and not nearly enough of a threat (still a fun game though)",False,10,0,"In Mario Party Superstars, the game gives you WAY too much money. In the original games, it wasnt uncommon to have at least 30 coins at max when you reach a star, making things like bowser spaces feel like a game changing threat to whoever was on the receiving end and it also made you feel luckier if the game decided for the cursor to land on something like ""100 Star Present"" because if it lands there, bowser runs away without giving or taking anything.

This also applies to chance time. Because the game gives you so many coins, its not uncommon for a player to get a lot of overpowered items like golden pipes which instantly take you over to the nearest star and then be in the lead in like 3 turns or more, so when it takes coins, it doesnt take that many, which again takes away the feeling on anxiety that players get upon someone landing on chance time or bowser.

Heres a few clips of peoples reactions to chance time:

A mario party 6 clip: https://youtu.be/pIJJTI-oODQ

A compilation of chance times from TheRunawayGuys: https://youtu.be/G-tSCHjP-FQ

A compilation of chance times from Brainscratch Commentaries: https://youtu.be/l8WaqT1Yz_g

Most of the time in the original games, chance time will take away a large amount of stars and/or coins at CRUCIAL moments in the game (you can see an example of that in the first clip).

I wouldnt mind the game giving you so many coins if it dished out more consequences (Example: Taking away coins for losing minigames, taking away stars for landing on the bank in bowsers magma mountain with no coins left, bowser being able to take more coins if the player exceeds 100 coins, etc)

Crash Bash - Obviously Sony‚Äôs attempt to make their version of Mario Party‚Ä¶ that was not good. Just minigames‚Ä¶ on repeat‚Ä¶.

Fortune Street - This is probably the furthest thing from Mario Party. There‚Äôs one minigame (essentially Day at the Races), and the rest is just monopoly with Mario, Dragon Quest, and a stock market. Still an amazing game though.

MARIOPARTY,Did/Does Mario Party Superstars NEED more boards?,False,31,0,"EDIT: This post is not to argue that there shouldn't be more boards. Rather, it is trying to argue that the game has a ton of replay value regardless of the board count in my opinion.

First, I obviously want more boards and content. I was hoping for DLC to be announced during the Nintendo Direct. I know MK8D is getting DLC 5 years later but still.

But in all honesty, the game is still awesome. Nearly all of the minigames are really good, and there are plenty of them. I never played the original Mario Parties (that will change with NSO), but I know the minigame selection was a lot smaller in earlier titles.

And I do know Superstars has a low board count, but they are all a blast to play. They each feel different, and they look great too. I like that the MP1 boards feel different than the MP2/3 boards.

For example, Peach‚Äôs Birthday Cake feels a bit like Monopoly with the Piranha Plants stealing coins and stars. Horror Land meanwhile has a really fun day/night cycle that can impede progress. The strategy for each board is so different.

Minigames are different in the sense that once you have a strategy for a particular one, you don‚Äôt have to change your gameplay too much. The beauty is that there are so many minigames, which helps to create variety in every session. Nailing the minigame selection it arguably just as important as the boards.

Another board or two may have cemented Superstars as the very best in the series. I do wish there were more boards (at least match the average of 6). Despite that, I think Superstars is still a phenomenal Mario Party and has a ton of replay value.

I think it‚Äôs an incredibly unbalanced board, but with a lot of potential. The fact you can buy 5 stars for 5-10 coins each, and make that purchase a multiple of times is even worse than Super only charging 10 coins per star. I think the only time stars should be that cheap is in a Pagoda‚Äôs Peak situation where the price consistently changes and you can‚Äôt really plan for it.

So, I would either‚Ä¶

-Make it so Twila only sold stars for 20 or more coins, or‚Ä¶

-Have it where every time someone buys a star, the price changes so I can‚Äôt just loop around the circle with a golden mushroom and get 15 stars for less than a hundred coins (which I basically did last time I played), or‚Ä¶

-I make it so that you literally don‚Äôt know the price Twila is charging. Twila rolls a
dice every time someone shows up, and then you have to debate if you want to buy it now or risk coming back when it could be lower or higher. You could literally pass him twice on 1 turn and get two different prices because it changes every time.

I see something about us needing a copy of the game and our own switch for each of us to play it? Is that true? We have a switch for each of us, but I'm not buying this game three times over just for this lol",,3,,4,noflair,public
