Rule 2: If a post has no purpose or is something that is incredibly similar/identical to a recent post, it will be removed.

Shitposts, jokes, memes and stuff in that area will continue to be allowed, put posts asking for upvotes, posts asking for others to repost it, and those knockout tournament things where you just repost the same image the next day but now something's been scribbled out all get removed.

The games tend to reference other games in the series and I don't think they do that just as an Easter egg. And there's no reason to assume all the games are disconnected at all. I honestly think every Mario game (except Smash, Sonic and Mario, Paper Mario, and the hotel mario type games and the mario kart games you find at arcades and Mario maker 1 are non canon, maybe bs super mario usa as well).

Is it gonna be New Donk City, Brooklyn, or something else entirely? 

My money is on New Donk because Toad's got buttons on his backpack showing off the Cascade and Sand Kingdom from Odyssey. 

I guess my only question is, if Mario's merely from another *country* and not another *world,* why hasn't he heard of the Mushroom Kingdom? Is the MK just an obscure, tiny little country that most people haven't heard of? Is Mario just bad at geography? This is the one thing that makes me wonder if he might end up being from another world after all.

Mario,Am I the only one that Just enjoys all the different Marios and each of their Voice interpretations?,False,14,0,"Maybe It‚Äôs just the internet having knee jerk reactions to 10 seconds of footage as usual, but I really don‚Äôt get why everyone is acting like the world is ending just cause Pratt‚Äôs Mario isn‚Äôt a pitch perfect replica of Charles. In my mind, I just like to think of all the different Marios as their own entity, and that there really isn‚Äôt a MAIN one.

Even though I love Charles to death and he‚Äôs done it the longest, I don‚Äôt think people should act like his voice is the only one that should ever be acknowledged. Super Show, CDI, Movie, and even the old OVA Mario are all valid, and deserve just as much respect as each other. He IS meant to be an Everyman, after all. He‚Äôs not locked down to one single version of himself.

Mario,The Super Mario Bros Movie Poster Breakdown | Poster Design Review,False,5,0,"I think the majority of you had played this game, I hadn't, but I had seen gameplays multiple times... So let's talk about the new movie poster of The Super Mario Bro. Movie. Here I will try to explain what the poster is telling, it's all about poster design.

[The Super Mario Bros. official movie poster](https://preview.redd.it/m9xtczdum3t91.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7bf06e0713ced863a8934e5b84d91cece4c277e)

A lot of movie posters like this, where we see the main character from the backside, and their world in front of them. This type of poster composition usually tells that this character is in the lead and he/she will explore the world, the adventure thing. And if you notice, the character in this poster is watching the castle at the top. This means one of the character's objectives in this movie will be to reach the castle, probably to save somebody, or if you know about this then let me know in comments about what is that castle about. This is the mushroom world, isn't it? Every design (characters and houses) is beautifully inspired by mushroom, which tells it's friendly and joyful, I mean it will have a lot of comedy.

If we talk about colors, supporting the soft corner design language, definitely falls somewhere in the kids' genre. Saturated-bright colors. And animation (render) style is photorealistic, a kind of Pixar or like Despicable Me. The studio which worked on this movie is Illumination, the one that gave us a character like minions from Despicable Me films. So, you can relate to which type of movie this will be.

The layout of the poster is a centered composition and which makes the two elements stand out (draws attention), the character at the bottom and the castle at the top, with the perfect silhouette.

Mario,My hope for The Super Mario Bros. Movie,False,3,0,"The trailer and the poster look convincing enough. They look like Illumination actually put in the work. More so than their past films. Here‚Äôs some hope that I have for the movie:

I hope the movie just looks downright beautiful. Nintendo is very good at making amazing visuals and background within their games. Super Mario Galaxy, Breath of the Wild, most stages in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. I hope the Mario movie won‚Äôt be any different in terms of beauty. I also hope that they‚Äôll have a good cinematic shots throughout the film. The shot of Bowser emerging his floating castle thing looks badass, and the part where he blew fire at the ice castle and it collapsed then turning to dust blowing to the screen while the Koopas cover their faces, *muah* that looked so cool. Luigi getting chased by the Dry Bones looks super decent as well. I hope that there‚Äôll be more cool cinematic shots like those. Similar to Yoshi sitting on the bridge during a sunset in Super Mario 64 DS. 

I hope the voice acting remains good. We all laughed and made fun of the casting reveal a year ago, but now that we heard it, it was a lot better than we expected. Jack Black sounds awesome. I thought he was gonna be a comedic villain but no, he sounds much cooler. Chris Pratt remains debatable but understandable. In my opinion, he doesn‚Äôt sound that bad but he could‚Äôve been better. We just need to hear more of his voice and then we‚Äôll have true thoughts of it. I hope he actually tried though, please Chris Pratt, don‚Äôt mess this up. I was very impressed with Keegan Micheal-Key playing toad. He actually sounds so good as Toad, it generally surprised me. Anya Taylor-Joy is a very talented actress. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll make a fine Peach. And Charlie Day as Luigi will be perfect. They unironically fit so well together. 


I hope the plot will be decent enough. I‚Äôm ok with the generic ‚ÄúBowser kidnaps Peach‚Äù thing but I hope they add more stuff to it. The trailer makes it seem like Mario‚Äôs early days so I hope his background is cool. Since Foreman Spike, the man who‚Äôs been forgotten for decades, is showing up, I hope Pauline shows up too. It only makes sense because she played a big role in Mario‚Äôs early life. Please, for the love of god, don‚Äôt make this a musical! All the casts have singing experiences. If it is a musical, all that hope I have is erased completely. 

I hope more characters show up too. Charles Martinet as Wario would be amazing. But if not, I hope his ‚Äúsurprise cameos‚Äù will be like Stan Lee‚Äôs cameos in Marvel films. There‚Äôs also seem to have Daisy‚Äôs logo around the poster. That means Miyamoto acknowledges her existence. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll show up in this particular movie but I hope she will in the sequels. Maybe a trope where Luigi falls in love as soon as he sees her face and slowly they start developing feelings for each other would be really nice. I hope Yoshi shows up as well.

I‚Äôve seen many people on the internet talking about potentially starting the ‚ÄúNintendo Cinematic Universe‚Äù. I don‚Äôt hate the idea, but they really really have to be careful in order for it to be successful. No doubt the Mario movie is going to be huge, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be a massive success. But if they ever do consider officially making that a thing, I just hope they don‚Äôt mess it up. 

I also hope it‚Äôs not an advertisement either. That would truly truly suck. I hope they‚Äôll add something nostalgic for us and hopefully the movie stick to the source. Which it already seems like it. I just hope the movie is good and becomes successful",,0,,3,,public

Mario,Is it better that Mario in the super mario bros will be voiced by some other voice actors instead of Chris Pratt,False,1,0,"Guys, what I am about to speak is controversial, so here goes. Seeing that fans of the super mario franchise have mixed reception on Chris Pratt as Mario, especially when we hear his voice in the trailer (eventhough I am okay with it) .

Fans just wanted Charles Martinet to voice Mario for the movie, but for me, I think it's unlikely for two reasons , one he is old and two he is a just simple person who is putting some voices on video games characters including Mario .

So I think maybe a different voice actor will portray as Mario in the movie instead of Chris Pratt since they don't like his portrayal, I thought maybe Jack Black would do since he is a video game nerd and he did a good job voicing Browser but I begin to wonder if he would be okay doing two roles or not.

And doing voice work will be no problem, just do it  for few months while the animated film will take a year or two , so if Universal, illumination, and Nintendo will agree to replace Chris Pratt with someone else to voice Mario in the movie beside Charles Martinet , It will just  take few months or a year to voice Mario for the movie and it will satisfy most of the fan of the Mario franchise eventhough  Charles Martinet  probably won't voice his character for the movie.

&amp;#x200B;

So in this thread we need to discuss , that is it better that Mario in the super mario bros will be voiced by some other voice actors instead of Chris Pratt",,4,,1,,public

Mario,My theories on Charles Martinet‚Äôs ‚Äùsurprise cameos‚Äù in The Super Mario Bros. Movie,False,4,0,"As you may know the teaser trailer was released a few days ago and we finally heard Mario‚Äôs voice by Chris Pratt. Thus far we don‚Äôt know  Martinet‚Äôs role in the movie but I‚Äôve been thinking about it: What if he WILL voice Mario? I have two ideas for this:

1. Judging by Mario‚Äôs lines heard in the trailer I think this movie will be the origin story, answering how did Mario become Super Mario. The warp pipe from which Mario was flung goes to Brooklyn. Some people have pointed out that Pratt has very subtle accent similar to the ones from the old animated Mario TV shows. Maybe in the beginning Mario sounds ‚Äùjust like Chris Pratt‚Äù but by the end where Mario presumably has the final battle against Bowser, we will hear Mario in the exact same voice as the games.

2. There‚Äôs a scene and/or a flashback which shows Baby Mario and Baby Luigi who are voiced by Martinet in the games. Maybe we see how Mario and Luigi grew up right up to their adulthood which could explain Luigi‚Äôs scaredy-cat personality seen in Luigi‚Äôs Mansion games and Mario‚Äôs joyful personality.

Lets assume that Illumination does NOT want to give Mario anything close to an italian accent, which includes anything like Charles Martinet, Lou Albano, or anything that would be even remotely Mario ish.

Let's also consider that Luigi as Charlie Day is not the best pick for Luigi, but everyone seems to be significantly less mad about Luigi as Charlie Day than Chris Pratt as Mario. I feel that this is because Charlie Day somewhat matches the personality of Luigi, so, playing by Illuminations rules, Charlie Day is the best pick for Luigi.  


Thus, here is my question in full: Playing by Illuminations stipulations, which means no Italian in either of the Bros, who WOULD be the best voice actor for Mario? You are only allowed to pick relatively big name Celebrities, and it has to fit Mario better than Chris Pratts performance.",,7,,4,,public

Mario,Story time: my experience seeing the live action Mario Movie in 1993,False,6,0,"So with us finally getting a trailer for the animated Mario movie, I thought I‚Äôd share my story about seeing the original Mario movie way back in 1993 when I was a young 12 year old.
Like most kids in the late 80s and early 90s, I loved Mario. I played all the games, watched the cartoons.  I got all 4 McDonalds SMB3 toys. You get the idea.  I read about the upcoming movie in a Nintendo Power Mario special magazine with the SMW guide. And that‚Äôs all I heard for a while.
I remember seeing promos and trailers and was like ‚Äúhuh? It‚Äôs live action and PG‚Äî13? Why doesn‚Äôt Luigi have a mustache?‚Äù CG wasn‚Äôt super common yet so I expected an animated movie in 1993. I was very confused.
So fast forward to the end of May. I was originally going to go to this DARE party at the local mall. As you know DARE was when you wasted an hour of school listening to a cop tell you ‚Äúdrugs are bad m‚Äôkay.‚Äù  I was originally interested in the party at the mall because I thought the big arcade would be open for this since it was by the food court where the party was. Nope. Just sitting in the food court with pizza and a DJ.  So I said ‚Äúscrew that‚Äù and my parents bought me a ticket to the Mario movie.  Probably a lateral move for me.   I remember the movie starts and you hear the Mario theme and that‚Äôs the closest it gets to anything resembling the games.  The entire movie experience was‚Ä¶confusing.  I kept expecting, I don‚Äôt know seeing something reminiscent of the games. I get why the Princess character was called Daisy (Peach was still Princess Toadstool).  Big Bertha the fish was a big black lady.  Iggy and Spike? Iggy is a Koopa kid but Spike was a regular enemy. Oh Yoshi looks ok. Hey and there‚Äôs a Bob Omb!!  Hey it‚Äôs Toad‚Ä¶and he‚Äôs gone.  Oh now they look like the bros.!
I walked out of the theater not sure what I saw.  
This was a tough time in my life. My grandmother was dying and my parents were divorcing so this was just another disappointment for me in 1993.

This is why I‚Äôm not bothered by Chris Pratt or Mario‚Äôs face being ‚Äúoff?‚Äù  I‚Äôve seen worse. Instead I can take my daughter to this new movie and just have fun.

Mario,Is Bowser really a koopa?,False,5,0,"Bowser is the king of the koopas, yet he is clearly very different from every other koopa regarding appearance - which makes sense, he is the big bad guy and should stand out from the rest. It does make you wonder though, is the king of the koopas really a koopa if he that much different from the rest of the koopas?

At first I thought that Bowser started out as a regular koopa - after all he has yellow skin and a green shell on his back like other koopas, so perhaps he simply grew larger and larger while changing more and more. However, he has a son that looks just like him except smaller, indicating that Bowser likely never looked like regular koopa at all.

Mario,We NEED to do what NINTENDON'T (Chris Pratt Voice Discussion + Possible Project Fix),False,0,0," 

I've been thinking about this for a while and want to voice this idea for either anyone who already LOVES this movie trailer minus Chris Pratt's Voice. I'm going to go out on a limb with my not-so-hot take that Chris Pratt's voice in the Mario movie so far has shown that he is not taking the role as seriously as he should be. We may recognize Mario by his Goofy mustache, bright red clothing, but the thing that I know most people think of is the iconic voice of Charles Martinet saying  ""Lets-a Go""! So hearing a voice actor who clearly does not have any passion for this project other than just being Mario honestly sucks. 

I've seen Chris Pratt in other roles, he usually never changes his voice because usually his voice doesn't really need to be changed for the certain role he's in, but this is a role that is so important to me and a lot others that you can clearly see in the community that it has caused us to laugh and semi panic. But in my opinion, not only do I think the voice is not going to be anything that would match our expectations, but I also believe that this detail will ruin a lot of dedication all the other actors most likely put it. Bowser sounds great in this movie because Jack Black put in the effort to find a voice that suits Bowser. Luigi himself hasn't spoken yet, but because we already know what Charlie day sounds like, at least we can assume that this will sound closer to a Luigi voice than Chris Pratt doing a Mario voice. 

With this in mind, I propose an idea. I have seen fans dedicate literal years of their life to fan games, fan projects such as art, animated skits, video game reviews. I've seen our community of Mario fans create some of the best fan projects of all time...so I think it's my turn to give back to this community. 

When this movie comes out, and we were right that the voice of Chris Pratt would sound exactly like the trailer and not fit the character at all, I would like to create a dub that's specifically removes Chris Pratt's voice and replaces it with a Charles Martinet-esce voice actor. Now, as somebody who regularly video edits on a daily basis, the hard part wouldn't be putting his voice in there, it would be to make the dub sound as natural as humanly possible with no hints or trace of the original. For this I would probably need to get the original OST for the movie, find a way to legally distribute the dub by having the users build the dub themselves through an editing file, and most importantly, finding a volunteer voice actor who is dedicated enough and hard-working enough to help me pull this off. I would hope that there are some dedicated fans that would be willing to help me out with this, but for now this is only a concept due to the movie not even coming out yet.

I could be possibly jumping the shark, I admit that, but if this movie really messes up the delivery and ease that Mario's voice deserves, I would like to do something about it. But for now, I would honestly like your guy's input. Do you guys think it would be worth all the effort, do you think this is a stupid idea in the first place, but most importantly... If I could get any specific volunteer to do this, who would be perfect for this role? Thank you all for reading my long tangent about a conceptual idea that won't even be ready to execute until 2023 üòÇ

I watched the trailer and I was happily surprised and even relieved with the aesthetic the production went with. It honors the games character designs while adding enough ‚Äúpolish‚Äù to make it cinematic. What I did notice is that every other character aside from Mario looks identical to their game counterpart. Only Mario had the most significant change. 

I‚Äôm wondering whether this was a decision purely for the movie or are we seeing Mario‚Äôs latest design iteration? If you look back in history, Mario has had some significant changes. His most current look began with Mario 64. 

What I find intriguing is his change in head shape and his eye shape. It is reminiscent of his design during his donkey Kong era. I also see some great design references to his look in The Super Mario Brothers Super Show animated segments!

Mario,Mario Movie Theory: Charles WILL voice Mario (kinda),False,3,0,"Everybody at this point has heard Chris Pratt's voice for *The Super Mario Bros. Movie*. While objectively it's much different than previous incarnations, I'm actually in the camp of those who don't mind the voice. I will not judge the voice entirely until I am in the theater on day one with my full attention. That being said Charles Martinet **is** Mario, and I think Nintendo and Illumination are aware of that. If you watch the trailer, the moment where Mario meets Toad, the voice is silent when he screams. Now it could mean that haven't found the right take from Pratt to insert, but it could be possible that Martinet might be dubbing over his screams. Now, I bet you're thinking that would jarring to hear two different people voicing Mario. And it would be, but this is how I think they will justify it. Seeing how this is an adaptation, the movie has an excuse to add or expand on elements we normally don't see in the games. That element I think they will focus on is Mario and Luigi's parents specifically their father. I believe there will be a sequence in the movie where Mario and Luigi are children talking to their father, who will look and sound exactly like Charles's Mario. When Mario gets older, Luigi will probably make a joke to him about ""having some of their father in him"", which is why Pratt's Mario will occasionally have Martinet coming out of him. I think if this was the case that would be a fun way to still honor Martinet. But it is a theory, so who knows, but regardless I'm pumped for this move. Thoughts?",,4,,3,,public

The trailer makes my theory seem more likely, because Mario says ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù when he sees he‚Äôs in the Mushroom Kingdom. I hope this is true. The idea of Mario going from living a normal world to discovering the bizarre and wacky Mushroom Kingdom sound funny and interesting. And it would be a nice callback to the first cartoon.

Mario,What is this Mario Bros game?,False,4,0,"I have been searching for years a Mario Bros game but I'm still not able to get with the name. I only have few hints since I played the game when I was 5-7 years old so I do not rembember too much but a hardcore fan would probably now with the vague memories that I still preserve so here I leave everything I remember:

\- I played the game in the school in old computers  when I was 5-7 years so probably it was a Mario Bros game between 1999-2001.

\- The first level had a ""green"" tematic and I remember that there were several green mushroms hidden in the map. This is the most relevant hint: In the first level before you completed it, you needed to jump a river/waterfall I think but If you did it in an specific point you would hit to a hidden/invisible square and reveal a green mushrom with an extra live.

\-The following levels had another tematic like in the sky and clouds and then lava (I guess that was level 4 that I always got stuck).

\- When you get a red mushroom your size increases and if you hit another square then a plant would appear (instead of a red mushroom) and you are able to throw unlimited fireballs. The design of mario changed to a combination of red/white and with a tail.

&amp;#x200B;

The design of Mario that I remember from this game was the 6th one (left to right) from the following picture:

Are we going to have flashbacks of Mario (as Jumpman) fighting a young Cranky, with present Mario meeting Donkey Kong for a skirmish until Cranky steps in to stop the whole thing, ending the rivalry?

I can confidently tell you: **No.**

Let's examine the facts:

* Previous Mario spinoffs have used the ""Mario is from another world"" plot before. The Dic cartoons, the 1993 movie, the Valiant comics, and more have used the old ""Mario and Luigi are ordinary plumbers from Brooklyn who warped to the Mushroom Kingdom"" backstory. This is most likely the plot the movie is using.
* Foreman Spike is in this movie. Spike's actor, Sebastian Maniscalco, [describes Spike as the Mario Bros' ""boss,""](https://movieweb.com/super-mario-bros-animated-movie-sebastian-maniscalco-foreman-spike/) which was the role he had in Wrecking Crew.
* Now, it wouldn't make sense for some regular person to warp to the Mushroom Kingdom, and *then* get hired by Foreman Spike ***after*** arriving there. No, it only makes sense that Spike was their boss back in the city the Mario Bros. came from originally, *before* arriving in the Mushroom Kingdom - whether it's Brooklyn, New Donk City, or whatever.
* Since Donkey Kong, and even *Cranky* Kong (the original arcade Donkey Kong) are in the movie, these characters would also most likely be in the Brooklyn/New Donk setting prior to the Brothers' arrival in the Mushroom Kingdom.

Anyone who's worried that Mario won't ""really"" be Mario, but will be some avatar assumed by some no-name self-insert character, it isn't going to happen. Everything we know about this movie points to Mario and Luigi actually being themselves, not identities assumed by someone else.",,12,,15,,public

Mario,I get why people Don like Mario's voice as it doesn't SOUND like him - but it does FEEL like him,False,8,0,"I think people are getting caught up on the fact that this voice IS Chris Pratt's voice, and that is understandable enough, but what I don't think I have heard anyone talk about is the DELIVERY.

This is specifically about the last lime we hear - ""Mushroom Kingdom, here we come!""

I feel like this actually captures the essence of Mario's personality perfectly. What is Mario at the core? Overall he is a joyful man who finds wonder in the adventures he has, even if the stakes are high. I think the delivery of that line actually compliments that chatacter well, it feels like Mario could be saying that.

Put it another way - if Charles Martinet said that line with those same inflections, it would feel right in line with anything else Mario says. Pratt's performance, from this very short line, would seem to indicate that he absolutely is trying to create a performance that fits Mario and that the only piece missing is the fact that he doesn't have Charles Martinet's voice.

This delivery seems to be a lot lighter than I would expect from Starlord or Owen Grady or even Emmet. At least, that is how I am taking it. He seems to have gone the effort to feel like Mario, even if he can't sound like it, and the actual delivery of the lines we hear seems to have gone completely ignored, which is kinda odd. I'm not sure why people haven't noted this yet, at least that I have seen.

Overall we don't know what it will be like in the final product, but from this trailer I feel we will get a Mario that is very loyal to character, including within the performance.",,1,,8,,public

But I think it's pretty much established already that the ""Real World origin"" has already been retconned with both Yoshi's Island and Odyssey/New Donk City. Considering Yoshis island takes place in the same world as the Mushroom Kingdom and so does New Donk City, I think it's pretty clear. And since Pauline basically confirms it's the same City from the original DK and we can assume uts the same from the Wrecking crew too, it's pretty much confirmed.

Also I believe most times Mario and Luigi were referred as to being from New York/the real world was in the live action movie/Mario Show and those aren't really canon so yeah.

Also for the movie I bet they're going to establish New Donk City, the events of the original DK kidnaps Pauline (Considering Cranky is going to be in it) and they might fuse the Wrecking Crew building with the DK building to make it make sense, and we might see the Current DK take the mantle of DK kidnaps Pauline like we see in the Mario vs DK games.

But I believe this movie will pass off as being an enjoyable video game adaptation. And so far, it seems to be sticking with its source material. (example: the Mario 64 penguins)

Jack Black as Bowser is honestly wayyy better than I expected, and I honestly think Kevin Michael Richardson‚Äôs Kamek sounds pretty good as well. I was especially surprised with how Keegan Michael Key‚Äôs Toad voice sounded. I‚Äôd rather have that than the obnoxious screaming Toad voices from the games. The overall design for the movie itself looks absolutely gorgeous and the character designs look better than most of Illuminations animation styles.

Now let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room‚Ä¶ Chris Pratts Mario voice. 

Now this might be a little controversial‚Ä¶ but honestly, i‚Äôm fine with it. Obviously it‚Äôs not my ideal casting choice for Mario, Far from it actually. I always thought Danny Devito would be good for the role. He‚Äôs actually Italian and him and Charlie Day have great chemistry. But as far as Chris‚Äôs voice acting goes, it sounds fine. i‚Äôve kinda just gotten used to it. 

Now the internet is acting like him voicing Mario is a death sentence. Obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I say give him a chance. He only said like 2 lines chill out. ü§£ü§£

Mario,A Super Mario World Headcanon Theory on why the Cave People are so dumb,False,1,0,"I don't really believe it and I was really bored and had too much free time, but it's something that I made as a headcanon just to make the Super Mario World cartoon better. The cavepeople have been continously  shown to be hopelessly dumb yet they still have a civilization and have been living there before Mario, Luigi, and the princess even came there as a vacation. It makes no sense that they are still alive at this rate when there are dinosaurs, Cave Caterpillars, and other types of danger. Luigi even had to teach them to crop and stuff.

What if there is something that is making them dumber than usual? In ""Mama Luigi"" Luigi reveals to Yoshi on how he found him and in said flashback, when they got there, the whole place was deserted. Koopa football players grabbed the princess, Mario has been attacked by a Koopa wizard, and he came face to face with a fire sumo. The reason why this happened, was because the cave people were absent. King Koopa was already there with his minions and waiting for them to come to Dome City in Dinosaur World. He could be responsible of the cave people's IQ drop just to make it easier to control the land and give Mario a hard time.

Further proof and explanations:

**Wizardheimer:** He is the most powerful koopa wizard, wether he worked for King Koopa or not, he may have something to do with it with his evil magic. In ""***Rock TV***"" it showed brainwashing magic is a thing.

**The Dino Riders:** They are smart enough to be a gang and ride motorcycles. The broken english is common language for the residents of the Dinosaur World. They are  outsiders of Dome City, so chances are only the residents of Dome City had been affected.

**Harmful berries:** It's possible that they encountered some berries that potentially damaged their brains, they used to be smarter but those berries affected them. Those red berries seen in ""***Gopher Bash***"" are quite common. They are now less aware of their sorroundings and their judgement has been impaired. Mario, Luigi, the Princess are not aware of this and they are sometimes affected by them but since they don't regularly eat them, the effects are reversible.

And then we get to the mid boss...

Bruh...what was with the random jump in difficulty? It actually took me over 10 tries to beat Sandy and Blizzy. 

And that was when the game decided to stop playing around, because so many battles after that were just really hard. Especially this specific one in world 4. Like, I know it's the final world, but who in their right thought it was a good idea to have to go through FOUR BATTLES IN A ROW without losing???

And the bosses. OMG. Not counting world 1, the only boss I didn't struggle with was the world 3 mid boss. Every other one was actual hell. As in it took me a few days to beat them hell. 

And this game is supposed to be rated E10+. How do you expect a 10-12 year old to beat some of these battles? It's ridiculous.

Mario,Who would have made a better Mario voice?,False,1,0,"To all the Mario fans out there who watched the trailer for the movie and though Chris Pratt sucked ass (like me). I understand that maybe listening to Charles Martinet‚Äôs Mario voice for two hours straight might be jarring to some people, so if you could‚Äôve picked another celebrity to voice Mario instead of Chris Pratt and Charles Martinet, who would you pick? Personally I would have gone with Tom Hanks. His voice feels more like Mario‚Äôs and he did a pretty good job with Toy Story (plus, he was originally cast as Mario for the 1993 movie before Bob Hoskins, so as a bonus it would be full circle for him). Also, he would‚Äôve attracted just as much at the box office if not more since he is a bigger star than Pratt.

Mario,How to redeem Chris Pratt as Mario.,False,3,0,"Contrary to popular opinion, I don‚Äôt hate the Chris Pratt Mario voice. Was he a great first choice for a generational video game icon like Mario? Probably not. 

That being said, from the two lines we received in the trailer, I didn‚Äôt necessarily hate his voice. I think this interpretation of Mario will be different from the video game counterparts, obviously because it‚Äôs a film, not a game. From the voice that we heard so far from Chris, I think they‚Äôre going for more of a ‚ÄúSuper Mario Bros Super Show‚Äù callback. It honestly makes sense, as Mario is more so a Brooklyn Italian than an Italian Italian. I love Charles Martinet's version of Mario, as I grew up on it. We should keep in mind, though, whether his voice would work for a feature film. The only lines he‚Äôs ever delivered for Mario are one-liners or noises when he physically moves. We don‚Äôt know how this voice would translate into lines and how well they could be acted in their original form. 

I think a good last-minute solution to this, unless they‚Äôve already included it, is adding Charles Martinet's voice dubs over specific actions. Mario jumping, for example, then going back to Chris Pratt. It would be both funny and satisfy certain fans. 

That said, I still think Chris Pratt was a weird choice for Mario. I don‚Äôt think it should be as overanalyzed as it has been since we have literally only received two lines.

Jack Black as Bowser is excellent, by the way.",,3,,3,,public

Okay so today is the day, we have finally gotten a first look at the Mario Movie [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMPCXuvL8EM) in the nintendo direct.

For the first bit we see Bowser raid a kingdom, Kamek has the classic euro accent similar to Mouser which I think fits him. We also see the Penguins from Mario 64 back, and they of course get beaten by fire since that melts ice. That scene was cool and I love the mix of comedy and action, seems like it really is going for the [Mario and Luigi](https://www.mariowiki.com/images/a/a5/MLSS_MarioBros.jpg) games type of style which is a big plus from me. We also get a look at Mario and yeah sadly he has an Emmet voice, but I like his scene, the bit with Toad was fine for me. Last bit in the trailer is Luigi running from Dry bones and there isn't much to say but at least we can confirm Charlie day doesn't suck as Luigi so yay!

Right so what I suspect will happen in the story is Mario and Luigi will end up being called into the mushroom world to help Princess Peach with the new threat of the Koopa Troops, and their goal is getting the 7 (because I doubt they would do 120 like 64 of Galaxy) power stars located in the different worlds (Your standard ice, desert, water, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

[I mean since we saw a snow world it only makes sense right?](https://preview.redd.it/3qwqtc244ds91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc9d946e02b9225ea1f01f936661a4a4ce1400cc)

Now bit more loose predictions I have are Bowser is gonna have a slight redemption arc at the end, because of the fact this does feel so much like those makes me believe there will be at least a few good bowser moments, also for other characters announced, I have a high likelihood that Dk will show up in the jungle world as a sort of friend or foe, it depends on if they have it in them to revert DK back to his grandfathers construction jacking routes.

That's all I have for now, but I want to ask you, what are your thoughts on the trailer? are you excited, what ideas do you have for the movie? Have a great day reddit!",,0,,1,,public

Mario,Super Mario Bros Movie: Plot Speculation,False,4,0,"Just combining a few scattered guesses from the trailer. I know that I personally like seeing people's theories, so I might as well share mine here.

PLEASE DO NOT spoil the movie in the comments, I know there were some leaks a while back; I have been intentionally avoiding those. Aside from that, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what might happen!

Alright, so to start off, I think there's a reason the film has been specifically branded as the ""Super Mario Bros"" movie and not just the ""Super Mario"" movie, beyond the title of the first game. I expect Mario and Luigi's relationship as brothers to stand as the core focus of the film. I'll get into this a bit later, and how I think their connection may play out, so keep this in mind.

So, the scene that the trailer starts with seems to be a pretty likely candidate for an opening. It introduces the main villain of the film, the danger he poses, his minions, and a catalyst for his actions: the Super Star. After this whole assault on Sherbet Land (I really hope that's what the kingdom is called lol), I think we'll move on to meet our protagonists in Brooklyn. Now, I don't think we're getting New Donk'd here, because Mario doesn't seem surprised at all about his own body when he arrives in the Mushroom Kingdom. Instead, I think that the people in the ""real world"" will look similar to Mario, Luigi, and Peach. This includes Foreman Spike from Wrecking Crew. The character is already confirmed to appear in some capacity, and he's likely the boss of the Mario bros. Here's where we get into the good ol' origin story, but with a bit more depth than the classic cartoons.

Mario and Luigi live together and work for either a construction, demolition, or plumbing company under their tough boss, Foreman Spike. Mario hates his job and is discontent with his lot in life, wanting something more for himself. Kinda the opposite of Chris Pratt's Emmet, which is ironic. In his frustrations with his work, Mario has grown a bit distant and irritable towards his brother, Luigi. Luigi is concerned for Mario and has noticed the shift in his brother's behavior. One day on the job, after a particularly heated argument with Spike, Mario comes across a mysterious green pipe. We all know what happens next. Mario gets sucked into the Mushroom Kingdom, an unknown land with unlimited possibilities for our discontent blue-collar protagonist.

As shown by the trailer, Toad, a member of the Toad species, is Mario's guide in this new world. Early on in the film, I'm sure we'll get plenty of references and such, Mario is introduced to Peach (did one of her ancestors come to the Kingdom from the real world?), Toadsworth is still alive hopefully, etc. We get some hints of some unrest in nearby kingdoms, and eventually, the adventure kicks off when the princess is kidnapped by the evil Bowser. At this point, Mario wants to prove that he can be something bigger, and having fallen for the princess, sets out with Toad to bring her back and defeat Bowser.

Back in Brooklyn, Luigi is super worried, because Mario has vanished. Spike thinks he just quit and left, but Luigi feels like something more happened. While trying to figure out where his brother went off to, Luigi stumbles across the same pipe that took Mario to the Mushroom Kingdom. Luigi goes through as well and eventually gets lost, determined to find his brother and desperate to leave this dangerous new land. Either during Luigi's arrival or later in his journey, the pipe back to Brooklyn is destroyed, locking the bros in this world forever.

To be honest, I don't have much of a clue about what will happen during the middle and latter areas of the film. Of course, Mario will go through some self-realization along his mission with Toad, and when Luigi and him finally reunite, they reconcile and Mario admits to his mistakes. Luigi also goes through his own arc, learning to overcome his cowardice to find his brother. We gotta have an emotional bro hug in here somewhere.

I guess during their journey, Mario, Luigi, and Toad will find out more and more about Bowser and his plans while following the trail of his minions. They'll come across Yoshi at some point (who does not speak English), and Donkey Kong will also be one of the characters they meet along the way. I suspect that we'll be flashing to Peach a few times throughout the film as well to better flesh out her character and give us more hints towards Bowser's plans for world domination. In the end, we get a climactic final battle against Bowser, the peak of Mario and Luigi's arcs, a death fakeout for Bowser in classic fashion, have Kamek do some sick magic stuff, yada yada it's going to be predictable but cool.

To close out the film, Mario and Luigi stay in the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach and Toad, happy to be surrounded by their new friends, their relationship restored, with newfound purpose and contentment. Teach kids good lessons about not taking things for granted, good friendship, and selfless heroism. Finally, the credits roll, with a beautiful medley of Super Mario songs from over the years.

Alright, other than a few random ideas for easter eggs, that's about the extent of my speculation. I am way more excited about this movie than I expected to be, and from what we've seen so far, I am hopeful that this actually turns out really good. I'm curious to hear what y'all think, about the trailer, my theories, and your theories, so make sure to drop 'em in the comments!",,0,,4,zShy-Guy,public

Mario,That trailer had the most generic sounding trailer music EVER!,False,3,0,"NOTE: This is just a criticism of the trailer, and not of the movie itself!

Anyone else getting tired of those same exact heavy drum hits sounds in every hollywood trailer ever? I barely realized the song at the end was the super Mario theme just cuz the horns are blaring so incredibly loud, it all just sounded like white noise.

I‚Äôve heard a few people express relief that it didn‚Äôt contain any kind of licensed pop music, but honestly I think this is just as bad, only in the opposite direction. It just sounds so stale. Apart of me would‚Äôve preferred some dumb pop song, cause then we could‚Äôve at least hopefully gotten some meme potential out of that. Oh well.

Regardless, I don‚Äôt expect the actual movie will sound like this. I know this is just something for the trailer to hype people up. It‚Äôs just a small gripe I had.",,4,,3,zPeach,public

Mario,Predictions/Theory on the Mario Movie,False,4,0,"Some of this may be obvious, but I'd like to write down my thoughts for the release of the movie.

In my opinion, Mario doesn't actually seem to be from the Mushroom Kingdom or it's universe at all. I think the explanation for the human protagonists being human will be that they are from Earth originally, and the moment we see in the trailer is Mario's first steps in the Mushroom kingdom. Mario and Luigi would probably know each other on Earth, and if the movie is as committed to being faithful to the Mario franchise as the developers of the movie would have us believe, I think it's likely that they could have been plumbers doing some sort of sewer work and a portal in the sewage system they were in is responsible for their presence in the movie. I feel like Mario's first moments in this new world are what we saw in the trailer, and the pipe he came out of has brick design similar to New York.

I feel like the plot will revolve around the power star Bowser takes and the things it can do. Bowser probably isn't from Earth, but it's possible he knows about its existence (the portals having given previous evidence to lead him to this conclusion, Peach possibly being one of these hints, as I explain below.) This may be a bit far fetched, when in every iteration of any Mario media previous to this the goal for Bowser was to overthrow the Mushroom Kingdom, but I think he wants to take his army to the real world to rule over the people there. In the brief trailer, Bowser and his army are shown as a pretty competent and formidable force already. He wouldn't feasibly need any kind of extra power to take over the Mushroom Kingdom, and judging from the teaser picture of it's clearly (as usual) peaceful and neutral status it doesn't have any better a defense than the penguins did. 

I think the stars power will be the central conflict. Mario and Luigi will team up with Peach to return to Earth and in the process stop Bowser from posing any threat to their home. There could be some live action scenes at the beginning and end, depending on how the plot plays out, and I think it would partially justify the cast chosen being so well versed in both voiceover and live action roles.

As for Peach, it is hard to comment on her role as she was absent from the first trailer. I think she is from Earth, but has been in the Mushroom Kingdom much longer than the Mario Bros. I think this because there is no reason for her to be the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, but it would be totally reasonable for the peaceful and quirky Toads to construct a whole ruling class and castle based around this interesting new sentient being who is essentially alien to them. It would fit in with the kind of animated movie shenanigan jokes the trailer had. This could also be why the Toad Mario meets when he first arrives (assuming what we see is his first arrival) is completely nonchalant about seeing a new human, and why he immediately decides the best course of action is to bring him to the Mushroom Kingdom- because he is the same species as their ruler. Another possibility is that Bowser has already captured Peach. She would be a direct source of knowledge on the real world and could lead him closer to the star and unlocking the power to go to the real world. In this case, the Toad is leading Mario to the Mushroom Kingdom for help and the Mario Bros would be a sort of reluctant hero duo in the movie as they realize they can utilize the powerups the world has to offer. This would make the movie more like the plot of Mario we expect-  our plumber friend has to stop Bowsers plans and save Peach. 

The possibility that Nintendo and Illumination wants a sequel if this film doesn't crash and burn are high, so I also think the Mario Bros will be forced to destroy the Power Star to save Earth and stop Bowser.

These are just some thoughts I've gathered after watching the trailer and having been a fan of Mario related media my whole life. I'm sure there is plenty wrong with my predictions, and I'd love to hear what others' thoughts are after the trailer. In my eyes, it didn't look bad, and by videogame movie standards, that makes it good!",,4,,4,,public

Mario,What my speculation for an introduction to the Mario Movie might look like,False,1,0," Note: This is just my imagination.

(Taking place after the whole thing with Bowser and the Penguins)

We cut to Brooklyn in the real world with Mario entering Foreman Spike's office.

He tells Mario that there's been problems at the construction site involving an escaped circus animal messing around and wants him to sort it out. 

So, Mario goes over to the site seeing the escaped animal which appears to be a big primate (Said ape may be Donkey Kong) going up the support beams and doing monkey stuff, he shouts at the ape to stop doing it as the primate doesn't listen making Mario run into the construction zone and climbs up onto the beams. 

This starts a little fun chase scene through the entire construction site with Mario and Donkey Kong causing chaos and havoc until they go into the sewer tunnels.

Luigi is somewhere in the city and has been hearing reports of turtles and crabs somehow coming out of toilets in people's homes, he goes down a ladder under the manhole into the sewers to find the entire place infested which is one big reference to Mario Bros from 1983. 

He manages to clear out the place despite his cowardliness and later sees his brother in red chasing a simian through the tunnels causing him to go after them. 

They run into a large green pipe with the two brothers wondering why it's there as they chase said ape into the pipe with the two separated from each other going into different pipes finding themselves into the Mushroom Kingdom starting off the movie. (later to reunite with each other).

(Mario meets Toad and Luigi finds himself in the dark forest)

Might not happen, but I'm okay with it.

Hence why as long as their voice is right, they will get hired. What i found weird is that somehow, other actors have been doing a great job at doing impressions for other characters, but Chris Pratt somehow doesn't do any impression at all, which means that the directors heard Chris' voice and were like ""yup, this voice is enough"". This begs the question, why do the directors think his voice is enough while the directors managed to follow the source material for other characters? I feel like there's something off happening in the middle of production, whether it's creative differences or commands from the executives themselves.

And Yoshi doesn't exactly talk either so that would fit the bill.

But there is another reason based on a potential scene I just cannot get out of my head now.

There would be a plot twist where Yoshi betrays Mario and sides with Bowser. They successfully work together to defeat Mario and Co and take over the Mushroom Kingdom. Standing at the large hill that Peach's Castle is on, Yoshi speaks (subtitled of course):

""Yes, yes. This is a fertile land and we will thrive. We will rule over this land! And we will call it... This Land!""

Suddenly, Bowser turns to Yoshi and roars, ""I think we should call it Your Grave!"" He breathes a stream of fire at Yoshi, which Yoshi dodges.

""Aghr!"" Yoshi cries as he jumps out of the way. ""Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!""

Bowser gives a laugh and says ""Mine is an evil laugh! Now die!""

Bowser tries to attack Yoshi, who runs away shouting ""Oh no God! Oh dear God in heaven!""

Mario,"In honor of tomorrow‚Äôs Mario Movie Direct, here is my honest attempt at predicting the plot of the movie.",False,5,0,"I was watching MattPat‚Äôs video about him trying to predict the story the Mario movie was going to tell and it really got my gears turning. Now, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be a musical (At least it won‚Äôt have more than one musical number. I for one cannot wait for Bowser‚Äôs minions to have a karaoke party and sing a cover of ‚ÄúSuper Trooper‚Äù called ‚ÄúKoopa Troopa.‚Äù) but call me crazy I think he might be on to something, especially about it being an origin story. So here I am following him up with this random concept the story could possibly follow. I hope y‚Äôall find it somewhat amusing.

The movie begins with the obligatory Illumination logo but with the Minions wearing Mario and Luigi costumes and jumping on each other‚Äôs heads. Then there‚Äôs a clanging noise and we open with a construction site. In it, a young Mario and Luigi are talking to their dad (maybe it‚Äôs take your kids to work day or something). Their dad, voiced by Charles Martinet, is a construction worker nicknamed ‚ÄúJumpman‚Äù (Mario‚Äôs original name from the og arcade game). Suddenly, Donkey Kong (actually a young Kranky Kong) bursts onto the scene carrying a kidnapped Pauline. Now, I wanted to make this as not-creepy as possible so instead of Cranky (a monkey) being in love with her (not a monkey) he instead kidnapped her because she‚Äôs the mayor of the city (like she is in Odyssey) and he wants to hold her for ransom or something. So Jumpman decides to be a hero and rescue her. We all know what happens next.

After a re-enactment scene of the original DK arcade game, Cranky is defeated and Pauline is saved, thanks to Jumpman. Young Mario witnesses all of this while Luigi got too scared and hid. Mario gets really inspired and starts hoping to be a great hero too, just like his father. Then the movie cuts to twenty years later, and we have a montage of Mario getting ready in the morning (he‚Äôll end up saying good morning to a photograph of his father, showing how Jumpman passed away in the timeskip.) Then we follow Mario (and most likely Luigi as well) as they hop, jump, and leap their way through New Donk City on their way to work. Then the camera pans up and the movie title appears in the morning sky.

I figured they‚Äôd use New Donk City instead of Brooklyn or anything like that because they‚Äôd want to distance the movie both from the real world and the 1993 Mario movie. Anyway, this upbeat scene is promptly cut short as the Mario Bros abruptly arrive at their dead end job as plumbers. They work for their overbearing boss, Foreman Spike, who is basically a J Jonah Jameson type character. They get yelled at, yadda yadda yadda. Anyway, they end up down in the sewers (somehow) and then there‚Äôs this tense scene of the Bros being hunted by this shadowy figure. Luigi is terrified, but Mario confronts the figure and it‚Äôs revealed to be... a goofy looking Seth Rogen Donkey Kong. He lured them into a trap and attempts to destroy them as revenge for what happened twenty years earlier to his grandfather, Kranky. (Here there‚Äôll probably be a quick montage through the years of Kranky constantly complaining about his humiliating defeat until DK finally gets fed up and tries to destroy Jumpman in order to make it stop).

But, of course, DK is an idiot and he doesn‚Äôt realize that he is attacking the wrong people. There‚Äôs another action scene here, this time reenacting the Mario Bros arcade game, as the Bros battle DK through the sewers. Eventually, all three of them accidentally enter a warp pipe and then promptly are sent to the Mushroom Kingdom. End of Act 1.

And that‚Äôs really as far as I got. I assume the rest of the movie will be a straightforward story of meeting Princess Peach and then Mario rescuing her (because he wants to make his father proud) from Bowser. There‚Äôs a lot of directions the story can take from here tbh, both in the movie and in sequels/spin offs. Can you imagine a Donkey Kong Country movie about DK returning back to his island after his Mushroom Kingdom adventures and discovering that King K Rool has conquered it? Anyway, these are my thoughts/terrible predictions and I figured I‚Äôd get them in writing on the off chance any of these turn out to be true. :)",,0,,5,,public

Mario,thoughts on the mario poster.... üòã,False,2,0,"this poster randomly dropped on me body and soul like a thwomp and i have never been so ready to analyze a movie poster üòä

\- i think the toads look kinda good !  maybe my expectations were super low, but i think they made a pretty good transition from the game to the movie; not much of a change in design which probably helps lol. although i will say that in some angles and in darker lighting, the toads' eyes can look really lifeless without the little light glare. ALSO, apparently toads have teeth? i don't know how to feel about this, but i figure it's more so to help with certain lip-syncing animations or expressions so i don't think those vicious jaws will be present all the time.

\- i love the little antique building with the 8-bit items. i will always eat up references to older mario titles, i can't help it üòî

\- i like that the buildings are mushrooms. i'm fairly sure they've done this sort of concept before but i still think it's cute !  although i'm certain ppl on twitter will make hyper-ironic-unironic posts abt how the toads are. cannibals or something bc their heads are like mushrooms and the BUILDINGS ARE LIKE MUSHROOMS??? ü§Øü§Øü§Ø it's a pattern i can always see it coming

\- THE PIPES. i love the pipes. assuming they're for transportation, i love it. it's a good way to implement pipes into the world-building of the universe, and it also gives mario's role as a plumber way more center-stage importance. i mean, if u live on the HIGHEST hill and the pipes don't work. and there's no italian plumbers with mustaches who wear red hats. ur screwed

\- there's also the floating islands and blocks and i don't really know what that's about, but i do wish there was bowser's airship &lt;/3

I wouldn't be this upset if there were other games that were well-received. For instance, with the party games - Mario Party Superstars is better than Super Mario Party (though I guess you could pitch in about this one too to confirm or deny this), so we always have something to look forward to.

Mario,Could the Mario Movie poster confirm that plot leak from a while back is real? (Potential spoilers),False,10,0,"Okay, so there was like this supposed plot leak of the Mario Movie a few months from someone who claimed they saw it at a test screening or something. Some of you may know of this, but if you don't know about it and don't want spoilers (assuming the ""leak"" was real to begin with), you might wanna leave this post. Additionally, I think I heard from somewhere that the leak might've been fake, but I believe the original post talking about it was taken down by Nintendo, so who knows?

Anyways, assuming it's real, the leak claimed that Mario fell into the Mushroom Kingdom first, while Luigi stayed stayed behind in what I presume will be New Donk City until he realizes that Mario is missing (like that one game, lol), before winding up in the kingdom later.

The leak said that Mario would be accompanied by Captain Toad on his mission. Now, it was said that ""the"" Toad and Captain Toad are two separate characters in the game universe, but it is possible that they retcon this and make them one-in-the-same for the film universe. We can see a Toad that is wearing what looks an awful lot like Captain Toad's backpack in the poster, seemingly greeting Mario and showing him around the kingdom. It's likely that this is the ""main"" Toad character we know in the games, the one that Keegan Michael-Key was confirmed to voice (unless all Toads are voiced by him, which I hope is the case because that would be hilarious). So, if the backpack is anything to go by, this would mean that ""the"" Toad and Captain Toad are the same character in the movie, potentially adding credibility to the leak.

The premise is based on the original three Mario games: Donkey Kong, Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. In the documentary The King of Kong, I learned that in the arcade DK, Mario never saved Pauline-it went to a kill screen at the end. I figured, from a character standpoint, that‚Äôs gotta weigh on a guy. 

So to be clear, this has nothing to do with the movie coming out in April. This is entirely my own story, and I had a blast writing it. I hope it‚Äôs fun to read.

Mario,My theories on Charles Martinet‚Äôs ‚Äùsurprise cameos‚Äù in The Super Mario Bros. Movie,False,5,0,"As you may know the teaser trailer was released a few days ago and we finally heard Mario‚Äôs voice by Chris Pratt. Thus far we don‚Äôt know  Martinet‚Äôs role in the movie but I‚Äôve been thinking about it: What if he WILL voice Mario? I have two ideas for this:

1. Judging by Mario‚Äôs lines heard in the trailer I think this movie will be the origin story, answering how did Mario become Super Mario. The warp pipe from which Mario was flung goes to Brooklyn. Some people have pointed out that Pratt has very subtle accent similar to the ones from the old animated Mario TV shows. Maybe in the beginning Mario sounds ‚Äùjust like Chris Pratt‚Äù but by the end where Mario presumably has the final battle against Bowser, we will hear Mario in the exact same voice as the games.

2. There‚Äôs a scene and/or a flashback which shows Baby Mario and Baby Luigi who are voiced by Martinet in the games. Maybe we see how Mario and Luigi grew up right up to their adulthood which could explain Luigi‚Äôs scaredy-cat personality seen in Luigi‚Äôs Mansion games and Mario‚Äôs joyful personality.

Mario,Who WOULD be an acceptable voice actor for Mario in the Mario movie? (If we play by Illuminations rules),False,6,0,"Alright, I have a question for everyone here. Lets assume that Illumination does NOT want to give Mario anything close to an italian accent, which includes anything like Charles Martinet, Lou Albano, or anything that would be even remotely Mario ish. Is Chris Pratt the best choice for Mario?   


Let's also consider that Luigi as Charlie Day is not the best pick for Luigi, but everyone seems to be significantly less mad about Luigi as Charlie Day than Chris Pratt as Mario. I feel that this is because Charlie Day somewhat matches the personality of Luigi, so, playing by Illuminations rules, Charlie Day is the best pick for Luigi.  


Thus, here is my question in full: Playing by Illuminations stipulations, which means no Italian in either of the Bros, who WOULD be the best voice actor for Mario? You are only allowed to pick relatively big name Celebrities, and it has to fit Mario better than Chris Pratts performance.",,7,,6,,public

Mario,Story time: my experience seeing the live action Mario Movie in 1993,False,7,0,"So with us finally getting a trailer for the animated Mario movie, I thought I‚Äôd share my story about seeing the original Mario movie way back in 1993 when I was a young 12 year old.
Like most kids in the late 80s and early 90s, I loved Mario. I played all the games, watched the cartoons.  I got all 4 McDonalds SMB3 toys. You get the idea.  I read about the upcoming movie in a Nintendo Power Mario special magazine with the SMW guide. And that‚Äôs all I heard for a while.
I remember seeing promos and trailers and was like ‚Äúhuh? It‚Äôs live action and PG‚Äî13? Why doesn‚Äôt Luigi have a mustache?‚Äù CG wasn‚Äôt super common yet so I expected an animated movie in 1993. I was very confused.
So fast forward to the end of May. I was originally going to go to this DARE party at the local mall. As you know DARE was when you wasted an hour of school listening to a cop tell you ‚Äúdrugs are bad m‚Äôkay.‚Äù  I was originally interested in the party at the mall because I thought the big arcade would be open for this since it was by the food court where the party was. Nope. Just sitting in the food court with pizza and a DJ.  So I said ‚Äúscrew that‚Äù and my parents bought me a ticket to the Mario movie.  Probably a lateral move for me.   I remember the movie starts and you hear the Mario theme and that‚Äôs the closest it gets to anything resembling the games.  The entire movie experience was‚Ä¶confusing.  I kept expecting, I don‚Äôt know seeing something reminiscent of the games. I get why the Princess character was called Daisy (Peach was still Princess Toadstool).  Big Bertha the fish was a big black lady.  Iggy and Spike? Iggy is a Koopa kid but Spike was a regular enemy. Oh Yoshi looks ok. Hey and there‚Äôs a Bob Omb!!  Hey it‚Äôs Toad‚Ä¶and he‚Äôs gone.  Oh now they look like the bros.!
I walked out of the theater not sure what I saw.  
This was a tough time in my life. My grandmother was dying and my parents were divorcing so this was just another disappointment for me in 1993.

This is why I‚Äôm not bothered by Chris Pratt or Mario‚Äôs face being ‚Äúoff?‚Äù  I‚Äôve seen worse. Instead I can take my daughter to this new movie and just have fun.

Thanks for listening",,2,,7,,public

Mario,Is Bowser really a koopa?,False,7,0,"Bowser is the king of the koopas, yet he is clearly very different from every other koopa regarding appearance - which makes sense, he is the big bad guy and should stand out from the rest. It does make you wonder though, is the king of the koopas really a koopa if he that much different from the rest of the koopas?

At first I thought that Bowser started out as a regular koopa - after all he has yellow skin and a green shell on his back like other koopas, so perhaps he simply grew larger and larger while changing more and more. However, he has a son that looks just like him except smaller, indicating that Bowser likely never looked like regular koopa at all.

So what gives? Is there an in-game explanation for this? Is he a mutated koopa? Or is he a rare breed, a one-in a million type of Koopa? Something like Ganon in the legend of Zelda?",,11,,7,,public

While objectively it's much different than previous incarnations, I'm actually in the camp of those who don't mind the voice. I will not judge the voice entirely until I am in the theater on day one with my full attention. That being said Charles Martinet **is** Mario, and I think Nintendo and Illumination are aware of that. If you watch the trailer, the moment where Mario meets Toad, the voice is silent when he screams. Now it could mean that haven't found the right take from Pratt to insert, but it could be possible that Martinet might be dubbing over his screams. Now, I bet you're thinking that would jarring to hear two different people voicing Mario. And it would be, but this is how I think they will justify it. Seeing how this is an adaptation, the movie has an excuse to add or expand on elements we normally don't see in the games. That element I think they will focus on is Mario and Luigi's parents specifically their father. I believe there will be a sequence in the movie where Mario and Luigi are children talking to their father, who will look and sound exactly like Charles's Mario. When Mario gets older, Luigi will probably make a joke to him about ""having some of their father in him"", which is why Pratt's Mario will occasionally have Martinet coming out of him. I think if this was the case that would be a fun way to still honor Martinet. But it is a theory, so who knows, but regardless I'm pumped for this move. Thoughts?",,4,,5,,public

I only have few hints since I played the game when I was 5-7 years old so I do not rembember too much but a hardcore fan would probably now with the vague memories that I still preserve so here I leave everything I remember:

\- I played the game in the school in old computers  when I was 5-7 years so probably it was a Mario Bros game between 1999-2001.

\- The first level had a ""green"" tematic and I remember that there were several green mushroms hidden in the map. This is the most relevant hint: In the first level before you completed it, you needed to jump a river/waterfall I think but If you did it in an specific point you would hit to a hidden/invisible square and reveal a green mushrom with an extra live.

\-The following levels had another tematic like in the sky and clouds and then lava (I guess that was level 4 that I always got stuck).

\- When you get a red mushroom your size increases and if you hit another square then a plant would appear (instead of a red mushroom) and you are able to throw unlimited fireballs. The design of mario changed to a combination of red/white and with a tail.

Are we going to have flashbacks of Mario (as Jumpman) fighting a young Cranky, with present Mario meeting Donkey Kong for a skirmish until Cranky steps in to stop the whole thing, ending the rivalry?

Mario,"I promise you, the plot will NOT be ""Some regular human turns into Mario""",False,16,0,"I've seen this speculation all over the place. ""Why doesn't Mario know what the Mushroom Kingdom is? Is it just *'Chris Pratt gets sucked into a game and becomes Mario?'""*

I can confidently tell you: **No.**

Let's examine the facts:

* Previous Mario spinoffs have used the ""Mario is from another world"" plot before. The Dic cartoons, the 1993 movie, the Valiant comics, and more have used the old ""Mario and Luigi are ordinary plumbers from Brooklyn who warped to the Mushroom Kingdom"" backstory. This is most likely the plot the movie is using.
* Foreman Spike is in this movie. Spike's actor, Sebastian Maniscalco, [describes Spike as the Mario Bros' ""boss,""](https://movieweb.com/super-mario-bros-animated-movie-sebastian-maniscalco-foreman-spike/) which was the role he had in Wrecking Crew.
* Now, it wouldn't make sense for some regular person to warp to the Mushroom Kingdom, and *then* get hired by Foreman Spike ***after*** arriving there. No, it only makes sense that Spike was their boss back in the city the Mario Bros. came from originally, *before* arriving in the Mushroom Kingdom - whether it's Brooklyn, New Donk City, or whatever.
* Since Donkey Kong, and even *Cranky* Kong (the original arcade Donkey Kong) are in the movie, these characters would also most likely be in the Brooklyn/New Donk setting prior to the Brothers' arrival in the Mushroom Kingdom.

Anyone who's worried that Mario won't ""really"" be Mario, but will be some avatar assumed by some no-name self-insert character, it isn't going to happen.

Mario,I think it's pretty clear Mario And Luigi are From New Donk City,False,7,0,"I've seen some arguments about the whole ""Ohh are they gonna say Mario is from New York/Brooklyn"" for the Mario Movie since he comes out of the pipe and all. But I think it's pretty much established already that the ""Real World origin"" has already been retconned with both Yoshi's Island and Odyssey/New Donk City. Considering Yoshis island takes place in the same world as the Mushroom Kingdom and so does New Donk City, I think it's pretty clear. And since Pauline basically confirms it's the same City from the original DK and we can assume uts the same from the Wrecking crew too, it's pretty much confirmed.

Also I believe most times Mario and Luigi were referred as to being from New York/the real world was in the live action movie/Mario Show and those aren't really canon so yeah.

Also for the movie I bet they're going to establish New Donk City, the events of the original DK kidnaps Pauline (Considering Cranky is going to be in it) and they might fuse the Wrecking Crew building with the DK building to make it make sense, and we might see the Current DK take the mantle of DK kidnaps Pauline like we see in the Mario vs DK games.

Mario,Super Mario Bros Movie: Plot Speculation,False,5,0,"Just combining a few scattered guesses from the trailer. I know that I personally like seeing people's theories, so I might as well share mine here.

PLEASE DO NOT spoil the movie in the comments, I know there were some leaks a while back; I have been intentionally avoiding those. Aside from that, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what might happen!

Alright, so to start off, I think there's a reason the film has been specifically branded as the ""Super Mario Bros"" movie and not just the ""Super Mario"" movie, beyond the title of the first game. I expect Mario and Luigi's relationship as brothers to stand as the core focus of the film. I'll get into this a bit later, and how I think their connection may play out, so keep this in mind.

So, the scene that the trailer starts with seems to be a pretty likely candidate for an opening. It introduces the main villain of the film, the danger he poses, his minions, and a catalyst for his actions: the Super Star. After this whole assault on Sherbet Land (I really hope that's what the kingdom is called lol), I think we'll move on to meet our protagonists in Brooklyn. Now, I don't think we're getting New Donk'd here, because Mario doesn't seem surprised at all about his own body when he arrives in the Mushroom Kingdom. Instead, I think that the people in the ""real world"" will look similar to Mario, Luigi, and Peach. This includes Foreman Spike from Wrecking Crew. The character is already confirmed to appear in some capacity, and he's likely the boss of the Mario bros. Here's where we get into the good ol' origin story, but with a bit more depth than the classic cartoons.

Mario and Luigi live together and work for either a construction, demolition, or plumbing company under their tough boss, Foreman Spike. Mario hates his job and is discontent with his lot in life, wanting something more for himself. Kinda the opposite of Chris Pratt's Emmet, which is ironic. In his frustrations with his work, Mario has grown a bit distant and irritable towards his brother, Luigi. Luigi is concerned for Mario and has noticed the shift in his brother's behavior. One day on the job, after a particularly heated argument with Spike, Mario comes across a mysterious green pipe. We all know what happens next. Mario gets sucked into the Mushroom Kingdom, an unknown land with unlimited possibilities for our discontent blue-collar protagonist.

As shown by the trailer, Toad, a member of the Toad species, is Mario's guide in this new world. Early on in the film, I'm sure we'll get plenty of references and such, Mario is introduced to Peach (did one of her ancestors come to the Kingdom from the real world?), Toadsworth is still alive hopefully, etc. We get some hints of some unrest in nearby kingdoms, and eventually, the adventure kicks off when the princess is kidnapped by the evil Bowser. At this point, Mario wants to prove that he can be something bigger, and having fallen for the princess, sets out with Toad to bring her back and defeat Bowser.

Back in Brooklyn, Luigi is super worried, because Mario has vanished. Spike thinks he just quit and left, but Luigi feels like something more happened. While trying to figure out where his brother went off to, Luigi stumbles across the same pipe that took Mario to the Mushroom Kingdom. Luigi goes through as well and eventually gets lost, determined to find his brother and desperate to leave this dangerous new land. Either during Luigi's arrival or later in his journey, the pipe back to Brooklyn is destroyed, locking the bros in this world forever.

To be honest, I don't have much of a clue about what will happen during the middle and latter areas of the film. Of course, Mario will go through some self-realization along his mission with Toad, and when Luigi and him finally reunite, they reconcile and Mario admits to his mistakes. Luigi also goes through his own arc, learning to overcome his cowardice to find his brother. We gotta have an emotional bro hug in here somewhere.

I guess during their journey, Mario, Luigi, and Toad will find out more and more about Bowser and his plans while following the trail of his minions. They'll come across Yoshi at some point (who does not speak English), and Donkey Kong will also be one of the characters they meet along the way. I suspect that we'll be flashing to Peach a few times throughout the film as well to better flesh out her character and give us more hints towards Bowser's plans for world domination. In the end, we get a climactic final battle against Bowser, the peak of Mario and Luigi's arcs, a death fakeout for Bowser in classic fashion, have Kamek do some sick magic stuff, yada yada it's going to be predictable but cool.

To close out the film, Mario and Luigi stay in the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach and Toad, happy to be surrounded by their new friends, their relationship restored, with newfound purpose and contentment. Teach kids good lessons about not taking things for granted, good friendship, and selfless heroism. Finally, the credits roll, with a beautiful medley of Super Mario songs from over the years.

Alright, other than a few random ideas for easter eggs, that's about the extent of my speculation. I am way more excited about this movie than I expected to be, and from what we've seen so far, I am hopeful that this actually turns out really good. I'm curious to hear what y'all think, about the trailer, my theories, and your theories, so make sure to drop 'em in the comments!",,0,,5,zShy-Guy,public

The premise is based on the original three Mario games: Donkey Kong, Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. In the documentary The King of Kong, I learned that in the arcade DK, Mario never saved Pauline-it went to a kill screen at the end. I figured, from a character standpoint, that‚Äôs gotta weigh on a guy. 

So to be clear, this has nothing to do with the movie coming out in April. This is entirely my own story, and I had a blast writing it. I hope it‚Äôs fun to read.

Shitposts, jokes, memes and stuff in that area will continue to be allowed, put posts asking for upvotes, posts asking for others to repost it, and those knockout tournament things where you just repost the same image the next day but now something's been scribbled out all get removed.

It's better than his typical high-pitched and exaggerated Italian accent (which is fine for just a few lines in a game) for a full feature-length movie, and I'm looking forward to see how it turns out in the end.

And the fact of the matter is, if Chris Pratt's voice does end up being the worst part of the movie, that means this movie is gonna be spectacular.",,5,,24,zDry-Bones,public

Mario,Is Bowser really a koopa?,False,6,0,"Bowser is the king of the koopas, yet he is clearly very different from every other koopa regarding appearance - which makes sense, he is the big bad guy and should stand out from the rest. It does make you wonder though, is the king of the koopas really a koopa if he that much different from the rest of the koopas?

At first I thought that Bowser started out as a regular koopa - after all he has yellow skin and a green shell on his back like other koopas, so perhaps he simply grew larger and larger while changing more and more. However, he has a son that looks just like him except smaller, indicating that Bowser likely never looked like regular koopa at all.

So what gives? Is there an in-game explanation for this? Is he a mutated koopa? Or is he a rare breed, a one-in a million type of Koopa? Something like Ganon in the legend of Zelda?",,11,,6,,public

I watched the trailer and I was happily surprised and even relieved with the aesthetic the production went with. It honors the games character designs while adding enough ‚Äúpolish‚Äù to make it cinematic. What I did notice is that every other character aside from Mario looks identical to their game counterpart. Only Mario had the most significant change. 

I‚Äôm wondering whether this was a decision purely for the movie or are we seeing Mario‚Äôs latest design iteration? If you look back in history, Mario has had some significant changes. His most current look began with Mario 64. 

What I find intriguing is his change in head shape and his eye shape. It is reminiscent of his design during his donkey Kong era. I also see some great design references to his look in The Super Mario Brothers Super Show animated segments!

Could this new updated movie design be a way of honoring his history while updating his future game adventures?",,7,,5,,public

Mario,Mario Movie Theory: Charles WILL voice Mario (kinda),False,4,0,"Everybody at this point has heard Chris Pratt's voice for *The Super Mario Bros. Movie*. While objectively it's much different than previous incarnations, I'm actually in the camp of those who don't mind the voice. I will not judge the voice entirely until I am in the theater on day one with my full attention. That being said Charles Martinet **is** Mario, and I think Nintendo and Illumination are aware of that. If you watch the trailer, the moment where Mario meets Toad, the voice is silent when he screams. Now it could mean that haven't found the right take from Pratt to insert, but it could be possible that Martinet might be dubbing over his screams. Now, I bet you're thinking that would jarring to hear two different people voicing Mario. And it would be, but this is how I think they will justify it. Seeing how this is an adaptation, the movie has an excuse to add or expand on elements we normally don't see in the games. That element I think they will focus on is Mario and Luigi's parents specifically their father. I believe there will be a sequence in the movie where Mario and Luigi are children talking to their father, who will look and sound exactly like Charles's Mario. When Mario gets older, Luigi will probably make a joke to him about ""having some of their father in him"", which is why Pratt's Mario will occasionally have Martinet coming out of him. I think if this was the case that would be a fun way to still honor Martinet. But it is a theory, so who knows, but regardless I'm pumped for this move. Thoughts?",,4,,4,,public

Mario,"I promise you, the plot will NOT be ""Some regular human turns into Mario""",False,14,0,"I've seen this speculation all over the place. ""Why doesn't Mario know what the Mushroom Kingdom is? Is it just *'Chris Pratt gets sucked into a game and becomes Mario?'""*

I can confidently tell you: **No.**

Let's examine the facts:

* Previous Mario spinoffs have used the ""Mario is from another world"" plot before. The Dic cartoons, the 1993 movie, the Valiant comics, and more have used the old ""Mario and Luigi are ordinary plumbers from Brooklyn who warped to the Mushroom Kingdom"" backstory. This is most likely the plot the movie is using.
* Foreman Spike is in this movie. Spike's actor, Sebastian Maniscalco, [describes Spike as the Mario Bros' ""boss,""](https://movieweb.com/super-mario-bros-animated-movie-sebastian-maniscalco-foreman-spike/) which was the role he had in Wrecking Crew.
* Now, it wouldn't make sense for some regular person to warp to the Mushroom Kingdom, and *then* get hired by Foreman Spike ***after*** arriving there. No, it only makes sense that Spike was their boss back in the city the Mario Bros. came from originally, *before* arriving in the Mushroom Kingdom - whether it's Brooklyn, New Donk City, or whatever.
* Since Donkey Kong, and even *Cranky* Kong (the original arcade Donkey Kong) are in the movie, these characters would also most likely be in the Brooklyn/New Donk setting prior to the Brothers' arrival in the Mushroom Kingdom.

Anyone who's worried that Mario won't ""really"" be Mario, but will be some avatar assumed by some no-name self-insert character, it isn't going to happen. Everything we know about this movie points to Mario and Luigi actually being themselves, not identities assumed by someone else.",,12,,14,,public

Mario,Predictions/Theory on the Mario Movie,False,5,0,"Some of this may be obvious, but I'd like to write down my thoughts for the release of the movie.

In my opinion, Mario doesn't actually seem to be from the Mushroom Kingdom or it's universe at all. I think the explanation for the human protagonists being human will be that they are from Earth originally, and the moment we see in the trailer is Mario's first steps in the Mushroom kingdom. Mario and Luigi would probably know each other on Earth, and if the movie is as committed to being faithful to the Mario franchise as the developers of the movie would have us believe, I think it's likely that they could have been plumbers doing some sort of sewer work and a portal in the sewage system they were in is responsible for their presence in the movie. I feel like Mario's first moments in this new world are what we saw in the trailer, and the pipe he came out of has brick design similar to New York.

I feel like the plot will revolve around the power star Bowser takes and the things it can do. Bowser probably isn't from Earth, but it's possible he knows about its existence (the portals having given previous evidence to lead him to this conclusion, Peach possibly being one of these hints, as I explain below.) This may be a bit far fetched, when in every iteration of any Mario media previous to this the goal for Bowser was to overthrow the Mushroom Kingdom, but I think he wants to take his army to the real world to rule over the people there. In the brief trailer, Bowser and his army are shown as a pretty competent and formidable force already. He wouldn't feasibly need any kind of extra power to take over the Mushroom Kingdom, and judging from the teaser picture of it's clearly (as usual) peaceful and neutral status it doesn't have any better a defense than the penguins did. 

I think the stars power will be the central conflict. Mario and Luigi will team up with Peach to return to Earth and in the process stop Bowser from posing any threat to their home. There could be some live action scenes at the beginning and end, depending on how the plot plays out, and I think it would partially justify the cast chosen being so well versed in both voiceover and live action roles.

As for Peach, it is hard to comment on her role as she was absent from the first trailer. I think she is from Earth, but has been in the Mushroom Kingdom much longer than the Mario Bros. I think this because there is no reason for her to be the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, but it would be totally reasonable for the peaceful and quirky Toads to construct a whole ruling class and castle based around this interesting new sentient being who is essentially alien to them. It would fit in with the kind of animated movie shenanigan jokes the trailer had. This could also be why the Toad Mario meets when he first arrives (assuming what we see is his first arrival) is completely nonchalant about seeing a new human, and why he immediately decides the best course of action is to bring him to the Mushroom Kingdom- because he is the same species as their ruler. Another possibility is that Bowser has already captured Peach. She would be a direct source of knowledge on the real world and could lead him closer to the star and unlocking the power to go to the real world. In this case, the Toad is leading Mario to the Mushroom Kingdom for help and the Mario Bros would be a sort of reluctant hero duo in the movie as they realize they can utilize the powerups the world has to offer. This would make the movie more like the plot of Mario we expect-  our plumber friend has to stop Bowsers plans and save Peach. 

The possibility that Nintendo and Illumination wants a sequel if this film doesn't crash and burn are high, so I also think the Mario Bros will be forced to destroy the Power Star to save Earth and stop Bowser.

These are just some thoughts I've gathered after watching the trailer and having been a fan of Mario related media my whole life. I'm sure there is plenty wrong with my predictions, and I'd love to hear what others' thoughts are after the trailer. In my eyes, it didn't look bad, and by videogame movie standards, that makes it good!",,4,,5,,public

The premise is based on the original three Mario games: Donkey Kong, Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. In the documentary The King of Kong, I learned that in the arcade DK, Mario never saved Pauline-it went to a kill screen at the end. I figured, from a character standpoint, that‚Äôs gotta weigh on a guy. 

So to be clear, this has nothing to do with the movie coming out in April. This is entirely my own story, and I had a blast writing it. I hope it‚Äôs fun to read.

I watched the trailer and I was happily surprised and even relieved with the aesthetic the production went with. It honors the games character designs while adding enough ‚Äúpolish‚Äù to make it cinematic. What I did notice is that every other character aside from Mario looks identical to their game counterpart. Only Mario had the most significant change. 

I‚Äôm wondering whether this was a decision purely for the movie or are we seeing Mario‚Äôs latest design iteration? If you look back in history, Mario has had some significant changes. His most current look began with Mario 64. 

What I find intriguing is his change in head shape and his eye shape. It is reminiscent of his design during his donkey Kong era. I also see some great design references to his look in The Super Mario Brothers Super Show animated segments!

Could this new updated movie design be a way of honoring his history while updating his future game adventures?",,7,,7,,public

The trailer makes my theory seem more likely, because Mario says ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù when he sees he‚Äôs in the Mushroom Kingdom. I hope this is true. The idea of Mario going from living a normal world to discovering the bizarre and wacky Mushroom Kingdom sound funny and interesting. And it would be a nice callback to the first cartoon.

Mario,I get why people Don like Mario's voice as it doesn't SOUND like him - but it does FEEL like him,False,9,0,"I think people are getting caught up on the fact that this voice IS Chris Pratt's voice, and that is understandable enough, but what I don't think I have heard anyone talk about is the DELIVERY.

This is specifically about the last lime we hear - ""Mushroom Kingdom, here we come!""

I feel like this actually captures the essence of Mario's personality perfectly. What is Mario at the core? Overall he is a joyful man who finds wonder in the adventures he has, even if the stakes are high. I think the delivery of that line actually compliments that chatacter well, it feels like Mario could be saying that.

Put it another way - if Charles Martinet said that line with those same inflections, it would feel right in line with anything else Mario says. Pratt's performance, from this very short line, would seem to indicate that he absolutely is trying to create a performance that fits Mario and that the only piece missing is the fact that he doesn't have Charles Martinet's voice.

This delivery seems to be a lot lighter than I would expect from Starlord or Owen Grady or even Emmet. At least, that is how I am taking it. He seems to have gone the effort to feel like Mario, even if he can't sound like it, and the actual delivery of the lines we hear seems to have gone completely ignored, which is kinda odd. I'm not sure why people haven't noted this yet, at least that I have seen.

Overall we don't know what it will be like in the final product, but from this trailer I feel we will get a Mario that is very loyal to character, including within the performance.",,1,,9,,public

Mario,I think it's pretty clear Mario And Luigi are From New Donk City,False,6,0,"I've seen some arguments about the whole ""Ohh are they gonna say Mario is from New York/Brooklyn"" for the Mario Movie since he comes out of the pipe and all. But I think it's pretty much established already that the ""Real World origin"" has already been retconned with both Yoshi's Island and Odyssey/New Donk City. Considering Yoshis island takes place in the same world as the Mushroom Kingdom and so does New Donk City, I think it's pretty clear. And since Pauline basically confirms it's the same City from the original DK and we can assume uts the same from the Wrecking crew too, it's pretty much confirmed.

Also I believe most times Mario and Luigi were referred as to being from New York/the real world was in the live action movie/Mario Show and those aren't really canon so yeah.

Also for the movie I bet they're going to establish New Donk City, the events of the original DK kidnaps Pauline (Considering Cranky is going to be in it) and they might fuse the Wrecking Crew building with the DK building to make it make sense, and we might see the Current DK take the mantle of DK kidnaps Pauline like we see in the Mario vs DK games. Then after the Bros leave to the Mushroom Kingdom, The kings go of to DK Country, and Pauline becomes a politician jazz celebrity lol",,11,,6,zDaisy,public

And when they returned to the livestream, the first thing I saw was the announcer saying ""what did you think of that trailer?""

Yes, they actually *went out of their way* to make sure that those who tuned into that livestream (which they PAID to see) did NOT see *a single second* of the trailer live.
